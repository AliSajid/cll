<h2>Chapter 1<br />
Lojban As We Mangle It In Lojbanistan: About This Book</h2>

      <h3>1. What is Lojban?</h3>

<p>Lojban (pronounced ``LOZH-bahn'') is a constructed language.
Previous versions of the language were called ``Loglan'' by Dr.
James Cooke Brown, who founded the Loglan Project and started the
development of the language in 1955. The goals for the language
were first described in the open literature in the article
``Loglan'', published in <cite>Scientific American</cite>, June,
1960. Made well-known by that article and by occasional references
in science fiction (most notably in Robert Heinlein's novel
<cite>The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress</cite>) and computer
publications, Loglan and Lojban have been built over four decades
by dozens of workers and hundreds of supporters, led since 1987 by
The Logical Language Group (who are the publishers of this
book).</p>

<p>There are thousands of artificial languages (of which Esperanto
is the best-known), but Loglan/Lojban has been engineered to make
it unique in several ways. The following are the main features of
Lojban:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lojban is designed to be used by people in communication with
each other, and possibly in the future with computers.</li>

<li>Lojban is designed to be neutral between cultures.</li>

<li>Lojban grammar is based on the principles of predicate
logic.</li>

<li>Lojban has an unambiguous yet flexible grammar.</li>

<li>Lojban has phonetic spelling, and unambiguously resolves its
sounds into words.</li>

<li>Lojban is simple compared to natural languages; it is easy to
learn.</li>

<li>Lojban's 1300 root words can be easily combined to form a
vocabulary of millions of words.</li>

<li>Lojban is regular; the rules of the language are without
exceptions.</li>

<li>Lojban attempts to remove restrictions on creative and clear
thought and communication.</li>

<li>Lojban has a variety of uses, ranging from the creative to the
scientific, from the theoretical to the practical.</li>

<li>Lojban has been demonstrated in translation and in original
works of prose and poetry.</li>
</ul>
