          <h3>3. Demonstrative pro-sumti: the ti-series</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   ti  KOhA    ti-series   this here,
                    a nearby object
    ta  KOhA    ti-series   that there,
                    a medium-distant object
    tu  KOhA    ti-series   that yonder,
                    a far-distant object
</pre>
    It is often useful to refer to things by pointing to them or by
    some related non-linguistic mechanism. In English, the words
    ``this'' and ``that'' serve this function among others:
    ``this'' refers to something pointed at that is near the
    speaker, and ``that'' refers to something further away. The
    Lojban pro-sumti of the ti-series serve the same functions, but
    more narrowly. The cmavo ``ti'', ``ta'', and ``tu'' provide
    only the pointing function of ``this'' and ``that''; they are
    not used to refer to things that cannot be pointed at. 

    <p>There are three pro-sumti of the ti-series rather than just
    two because it is often useful to distinguish between objects
    that are at more than two different distances. Japanese, among
    other languages, regularly does this. Until the 16th century,
    English did too; the pronoun ``that'' referred to something at
    a medium distance from the speaker, and the now-archaic pronoun
    ``yon'' to something far away.</p>

    <p>In conversation, there is a special rule about ``ta'' and
    ``tu'' that is often helpful in interpreting them. When used
    contrastingly, ``ta'' refers to something that is near the
    listener, whereas ``tu'' refers to something far from both
    speaker and listener. This makes for a parallelism between
    ``ti'' and ``mi'', and ``ta'' and ``do'', that is convenient
    when pointing is not possible; for example, when talking by
    telephone. In written text, on the other hand, the meaning of
    the ti-series is inherently vague; is the writer to be taken as
    pointing to something, and if so, to what? In all cases, what
    counts as ``near'' and ``far away'' is relative to the current
    situation.</p>

    <p>It is important to distinguish between the English pronoun
    ``this'' and the English adjective ``this'' as in ``this
    boat''. The latter is not represented in Lojban by ``ti'':</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">3.1)</a>  le ti bloti
    the this boat
</pre>
    does not mean ``this boat'' but rather ``this one's boat'',
    ``the boat associated with this thing'', as explained in <a
    href="../../8/1/">Chapter 8</a>. A correct Lojban translation
    of <a href="../3/#1">Example 3.1</a> is 
<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">3.2)</a>  le vi bloti
    the here boat
    the nearby boat
</pre>
    using a spatial tense before the selbri ``bloti'' to express
    that the boat is near the speaker. (Tenses are explained in
    full in <a href="../../11/1/">Chapter 11</a>.) Another correct
    translation would be: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">3.3)</a>  ti noi bloti
    this-thing which-incidentally is-a-boat
</pre>
    There are no demonstrative pro-bridi to correspond to the
    ti-series: you can't point to a relationship.
