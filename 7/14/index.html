          <h3>14. The identity predicate: du</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
<pre>
     du      GOhA                identity
</pre>
</p>

    <p>The cmavo “du” has the place structure: 

<pre>
      x1 is identical with x2, x3, ...
</pre>

    and appears in selma'o GOhA for reasons of convenience: it is
    not a pro-bridi. “du” serves as mathematical “=”, and
    outside mathematical contexts is used for defining or
    identifying. Mathematical examples may be found in <a
    href="../../18/1/">Chapter 18</a>.</p> 

    <p>The main difference between

<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">14.1)</a>  ko'a du le nanmu
     it-1 is-identical-to the man
</pre>

    and 

<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">14.2)</a>  ko'a mintu le nanmu
     it-1 is-the-same-as the man
</pre>

    is this defining nature. <a href="../14/#1">Example 14.1</a>
    presumes that the speaker is responding to a request for
    information about what “ko'a” refers to, or that the speaker
    in some way feels the need to define “ko'a” for later
    reference. A bridi with “du” is an identity sentence,
    somewhat metalinguistically saying that all attached sumti are
    representations for the same referent. There may be any number
    of sumti associated with “du”, and all are said to be
    identical. 

    <p><a href="../14/#2">Example 14.2</a>, however, predicates; it
    is used to make a claim about the identity of “ko'a”, which
    presumably has been defined previously.</p>

    <p>Note: “du” historically is derived from “dunli”, but
    “dunli” has a third place which “du” lacks: the standard of
    equality.</p>
