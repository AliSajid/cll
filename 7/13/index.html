          <h3>13. Pro-sumti and pro-bridi cancelling</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
     da'o    DAhO                cancel all pro-sumti/pro-bridi
</pre>
    How long does a pro-sumti or pro-bridi remain stable? In other
    words, once we know the referent of a pro-sumti or pro-bridi,
    how long can we be sure that future uses of the same cmavo have
    the same referent? The answer to this question depends on which
    series the cmavo belongs to. 

    <p>Personal pro-sumti are stable until there is a change of
    speaker or listener, possibly signaled by a vocative.
    Assignable pro-sumti and pro-bridi last indefinitely or until
    rebound with “goi” or “cei”. Bound variable pro-sumti and
    pro-bridi also generally last until re-bound; details are
    available in <a href="../../16/1/">Chapter 16</a>.</p>

    <p>Utterance pro-sumti are stable only within the utterance in
    which they appear; similarly, reflexive pro-sumti are stable
    only within the bridi in which they appear; and “ke'a” is
    stable only within its relative clause. Anaphoric pro-sumti and
    pro-bridi are stable only within narrow limits depending on the
    rules for the particular cmavo.</p>

    <p>Demonstrative pro-sumti, indefinite pro-sumti and pro-bridi,
    and sumti and bridi questions potentially change referents
    every time they are used.</p>

    <p>However, there are ways to cancel all pro-sumti and
    pro-bridi, so that none of them have known referents. (Some,
    such as “mi”, will acquire the same referent as soon as they
    are used again after the cancellation.) The simplest way to
    cancel everything is with the cmavo “da'o” of selma'o DAhO,
    which is used solely for this purpose; it may appear anywhere,
    and has no effect on the grammar of texts containing it. One
    use of “da'o” is when entering a conversation, to indicate
    that one’s pro-sumti assignments have nothing to do with any
    assignments already made by other participants in the
    conversation.</p>

    <p>In addition, the cmavo “ni'o” and “no'i” of selma'o
    NIhO, which are used primarily to indicate shifts in topic, may
    also have the effect of canceling pro-sumti and pro-bridi
    assignments, or of reinstating ones formerly in effect. More
    explanations of NIhO can be found in <a
    href="../../19/1/">Chapter 19</a>.</p>
