          <h3>9. sumti and bridi questions: “ma” and “mo”</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<pre>
     ma      KOhA                sumti question
     mo      GOhA                bridi question
</pre>
</p>

    <p>Lojban questions are more fully explained in <a
    href="../../19/1/">Chapter 19</a>, but “ma” and “mo” are
    listed in this chapter for completeness. The cmavo “ma” asks
    for a sumti to make the bridi true: 

<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">9.1)</a>  do klama ma
     You go to-what-destination?
     Where are you going?
</pre>

    The cmavo “mo”, on the other hand, asks for a selbri which
    makes the question bridi true. If the answer is a full bridi,
    then the arguments of the answer override the arguments in the
    question, in the same manner as the go'i-series cmavo. A simple
    example is: 

<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">9.2)</a>  do mo
     What predicate is true as applied to you?
     How are you?
     What are you doing?
     What are you?
</pre>

    <a href="../9/#3">Example 9.3</a> is a truly pregnant question
    that will have several meanings depending on context.</p>

    <p>(One thing it probably does not mean is “Who are you?” in
    the sense “What is your name/identity?”, which is better
    expressed by:

<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">9.3)</a>  ma cmene do
     What sumti is-the-name-of you?
     What is your name?
</pre>

    or even 

<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">9.4)</a>  doi ma
     O [what sumti?]
</pre>

    which uses the vocative “doi” to address someone, and
    simultaneously asks who the someone is.)</p> 

    <p>A further example of “mo”:

<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">9.5)</a>  lo mo prenu cu darxi do .i barda
     A [what selbri?] type-of person hit you? (Observative:) A big thing.
     Which person hit you? The big one.
</pre>
</p>

    <p>When “ma” or “mo” is repeated, multiple questions are being
    asked simultaneously: 

<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">9.6)</a>  ma djuno ma
     [What sumti] knows [what sumti]?
     Who knows what?
</pre>
</p>
