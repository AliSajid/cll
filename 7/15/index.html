          <h3>15. lujvo based on pro-sumti</h3>

    <p>There exist rafsi allocated to a few cmavo of selma’o KOhA,
    but they are rarely used. (See <a href=../16/>Section 16</a>
    for a complete list.) The obvious way to use them is as
    internal sumti, filling in an appropriate place of the gismu or
    lujvo to which they are attached; as such, they usually stand
    as the first rafsi in their lujvo.</p>

    <p>Thus “donta’a”, meaning “you-talk”, would be interpreted
    as “tavla be do”, and would have the place structure</p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">15.1)</a>    t1 talks to you about subject t3 in language t4
</pre>
    since t2 (the addressee) is already known to be “do”. 

    <p>On the other hand, the lujvo “donma’o”, literally
    “you-cmavo”, which means “a second person personal
    pronoun”, would be interpreted as “cmavo be zo do”, and have
    the place structure:</p>
<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">15.2)</a>    c1 is a second person pronoun in language c4
</pre>
    since both the c2 place (the grammatical class) and the c3
    place (the meaning) are obvious from the context “do”. 

    <p>An anticipated use of rafsi for cmavo in the “fo’a” series
    is to express terjvo which can’t be expressed in a convenient
    rafsi form, because they are too long to express, or are
    formally inconvenient (fu’ivla, cmene, and so forth.) An
    example would be:</p>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">15.3)</a>    fo’a goi le kulnrsu,omi .i lo fo’arselsanga
    x6 stands for Finnish-culture.  An x6-song
</pre>
    Finally, lujvo involving “zi’o” are also possible, and are
    fully discussed in <a href="../../12/1/">Chapter 12</a>. In
    brief, the convention is to use the rafsi for “zi’o” as a
    prefix immediately followed by the rafsi for the number of the
    place to be deleted. Thus, if we consider a beverage (something
    drunk without considering who, if anyone, drinks it) as a “se
    pinxe be zi’o”, the lujvo corresponding to this is
    “zilrelselpinxe” (deleting the second place of “se pinxe”).
    Deleting the x1 place in this fashion would move all remaining
    places up by one. This would mean that “zilpavypinxe” has the
    same place structure as “zilrelselpinxe”, and “lo
    zilpavypinxe”, like “lo zilrelselpinxe”, refers to a
    beverage, and not to a non-existent drinker. 

    <p>The pro-bridi “co’e”, “du”, and “bu’a” also have
    rafsi, which can be used just as if they were gismu. The
    resulting lujvo have (except for “du”-based lujvo) highly
    context-dependent meanings.</p>
