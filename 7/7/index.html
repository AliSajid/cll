          <h3><a id="7" name="7">7. Indefinite pro-sumti and pro-bridi: the zo'e-series and
    the co'e-series</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   zo'e    KOhA    zo'e-series the obvious value
    zu'i    KOhA    zo'e-series the typical value
    zi'o    KOhA    zo'e-series the nonexistent value
    co'e    GOhA    co'e-series has the obvious relationship
</pre>
    The cmavo of the zo'e-series represent indefinite, unspecified
    sumti. The cmavo ``zo'e'' represents an elliptical value for
    this sumti place; it is the optional spoken place holder when a
    sumti is skipped without being specified. Note that the
    elliptical value is not always the typical value. The
    properties of ellipsis lead to an elliptical sumti being
    defined as ``whatever I want it to mean but haven't bothered to
    figure out, or figure out how to express''. 

    <p>The cmavo ``zu'i'', on the other hand, represents the
    typical value for this place of this bridi:</p>
<pre>
<a id="7-1" name="7-1">7.1)</a>  mi klama le bartu be le zdani
        le nenri be le zdani
        zu'i zu'i
    I go to-the outside of the house
        from-the inside of the house
        [by-typical-route] [by-typical-means]
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#7-1">Example 7.1</a>, the first ``zu'i''
    probably means something like ``by the door'', and the second
    ``zu'i'' probably means something like ``on foot'', those being
    the typical route and means for leaving a house. On the other
    hand, if you are at the top of a high rise during a fire,
    neither ``zu'i'' is appropriate. It's also common to use
    ``zu'i'' in ``by standard'' places.</p>

    <p>Finally, the cmavo ``zi'o'' represents a value which does
    not even exist. When a bridi fills one of its places with
    ``zi'o'', what is really meant is that the selbri has a place
    which is irrelevant to the true relationship the speaker wishes
    to express. For example, the place structure of ``zbasu''
    is</p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>actor x1 makes x2 from materials x3</dd>
    </dl>
    Consider the sentence 

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>Living things are made from cells.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>This cannot be correctly expressed as:</p>
<pre>
<a id="7-2" name="7-2">7.2)</a>  loi jmive cu se zbasu [zo'e] fi loi selci
    The-mass-of living-things is-made [by-something]
        from the-mass-of cells
</pre>
    because the ``zo'e'', expressed or understood, in <a
    href="#7-2">Example 7.2</a> indicates that there is still a
    ``maker'' in this relationship. We do not generally suppose,
    however, that someone ``makes'' living things from cells. The
    best answer is probably to find a different selbri, one which
    does not imply a ``maker'': however, an alternative strategy is
    to use ``zi'o'' to eliminate the maker place: 
<pre>
<a id="7-3" name="7-3">7.3)</a>  loi jmive cu se zbasu zi'o
        loi selci
    The-mass-of living-things is-made [without-maker]
        from the-mass-of cells.
</pre>
    Note: The use of ``zi'o'' to block up, as it were, one place of
    a selbri actually creates a new selbri with a different place
    structure. Consider the following examples: 
<pre>
<a id="7-4" name="7-4">7.4)</a>  mi zbasu le dinju loi mudri
    I make the building from-some-of-the-mass-of wood.
    I make the building out of wood.

<a id="7-5" name="7-5">7.5)</a>   zi'o zbasu le dinju
        loi mudri
    [without-maker] makes the building
        from-some-of-the-mass-of wood.
    The building is made out of wood.

<a id="7-6" name="7-6">7.6)</a>   mi zbasu zi'o
        loi mudri
    I make [without-thing-made]
        from-some-of-the-mass-of wood.
    I build using wood.

<a id="7-7" name="7-7">7.7)</a>   mi zbasu loi mudri zi'o
    I make the building [without-material].
    I make the building.
</pre>

    <p>If <a href="#7-4">Example 7.4</a> is true, then <a
    href="#7-5">Examples 7.5</a> through <a href="#7-7">7.7</a>
    must be true also. However, <a href="#7-3">Example 7.3</a>
    does not correspond to any sentence with three regular
    (non-``zi'o'') sumti.</p>

    <p>The pro-bridi ``co'e'' (which by itself constitutes the
    co'e-series of selma'o GOhA) represents the elliptical selbri.
    Lojban grammar does not allow the speaker to merely omit a
    selbri from a bridi, although any or all sumti may be freely
    omitted. Being vague about a relationship requires the use of
    ``co'e'' as a selbri place-holder:</p>
<pre>
<a id="7-8" name="7-8">7.8)</a>  mi troci le nu
        mi co'e le vorme
    I try the event-of
        my [doing-the-obvious-action] to-the door.
    I try the door.
</pre>

    <p>The English version means, and the Lojban version probably
    means, that I try to open the door, but the relationship of
    opening is not actually specified; the Lojbanic listener must
    guess it from context. Lojban, unlike English, makes it clear
    that there is an implicit action that is not being
    expressed.</p>

    <p>The form of ``co'e'' was chosen to resemble ``zo'e''; the
    cmavo ``do'e'' of selma'o BAI (see <a href="../../9/1/">Chapter
    9</a>) also belongs to the same group of cmavo.</p>

    <p>Note that ``do'i'', of the di'u-series, is also a kind of
    indefinite pro-sumti: it is indefinite in referent, but is
    restricted to referring only to an utterance.</p>
