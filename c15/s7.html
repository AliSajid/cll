    <h3><a id="s7" name="s7">7. Negation of minor grammatical constructs</h3>

    <p>We have a few other constructs that can be negated, all of
    them based on negating individual words. For such negation, we
    use the suffix-combining negator, which is ``nai''. ``nai'', by
    the way, is almost always written as a compound into the
    previous word that it is negating, although it is a regular
    separate-word cmavo and the sole member of selma'o NAI.</p>

    <p>Most of these negation forms are straightforward, and should
    be discussed and interpreted in connection with an analysis of
    the particular construct being negated. Thus, we will not go
    into much detail here.</p>

    <p>The following are places where ``nai'' is used:</p>

    <p>When attached to tenses and modals (see <a
    href="../c10/s1.html">Chapter 10</a>), the ``nai'' suffix usually
    indicates a contradictory negation of the tagged bridi. Thus
    ``punai'' as a tense inflection means ``not-in-the-past'', or
    ``not-previously'', without making any implication about any
    other time period unless explicitly stated. As a result,</p>
<pre>
<a id="e7d1" name="e7d1">7.1)</a>  mi na pu klama le zarci
    I [false] [past] go-to the store.
    I didn't go to the store.
</pre>
    and 
<pre>
<a id="e7d2" name="e7d2">7.2)</a>  mi punai klama le zarci
    I [past-not] go-to the store.
    I didn't go to the store.
</pre>
    mean exactly the same thing, although there may be a difference
    of emphasis. 

    <p>Tenses and modals can be logically connected, with the
    logical connectives containing contradictory negations; this
    allows negated tenses and modals to be expressed positively
    using logical connectives. Thus ``punai je ca'' means the same
    thing as ``pu naje ca''.</p>

    <p>As a special case, a ``-nai'' attached to the interval
    modifiers of selma'o TAhE, ROI, or ZAhO (explained in <a
    href="../c10/s1.html">Chapter 10</a>) signals a scalar
    negation:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e7d3" name="e7d3">7.3)</a>  mi paroinai dansu le bisli
    I [once] [not] dance-on the ice
</pre>
    means that I dance on the ice either zero or else two or more
    times within the relevant time interval described by the bridi.
    <a href="#e7d3">Example 7.3</a> is very different from the
    English use of ``not once'', which is an emphatic way of saying
    ``never'' --- that is, exactly zero times. 

    <p>In indicators and attitudinals of selma'o UI or CAI, ``nai''
    denotes a polar negation. As discussed in <a
    href="../c13/s1.html">Chapter 13</a>, most indicators have an
    implicit scale, and ``nai'' changes the indicator to refer to
    the opposite end of the scale. Thus ``.uinai'' expresses
    unhappiness, and ``.ienai'' expresses disagreement (not
    ambivalence, which is expressed with the neutral or undecided
    intensity as ``.iecu'i'').</p>

    <p>Vocative cmavo of selma'o COI are considered a kind of
    indicator, but one which identifies the listener. Semantically,
    we could dispense with about half of the COI selma'o words
    based on the scalar paradigm. For example, ``co'o'' could be
    expressed as ``coinai''. However, this is not generally
    done.</p>

    <p>Most of the COI cmavo are used in what are commonly called
    protocol situations. These protocols are used, for example, in
    radio conversations, which often take place in a noisy
    environment. The negatives of protocol words tend to convey
    diametrically opposite communications situations (as might be
    expected). Therefore, only one protocol vocative is dependent
    on ``nai'': negative acknowledgement, which is ``je'enai'' (``I
    didn't get that'').</p>

    <p>Unlike the attitudinal indicators, which tend to be
    unimportant in noisy situations, the protocol vocatives become
    more important. So if, in a noisy environment, a protocol
    listener makes out only ``nai'', he or she can presume it is a
    negative acknowledgement and repeat transmission or otherwise
    respond accordingly. <a href="../c13/s1.html">Chapter 13</a>
    provides more detail on this topic.</p>

    <p>The abstractors of selma'o NU follow the pattern of the
    tenses and modals. NU allows negative abstractions, especially
    in compound abstractions connected by logical connectives:
    ``su'ujeninai'', which corresponds to ``su'u jenai ni'' just as
    ``punai je ca'' corresponds to ``pu naje ca''. It is not clear
    how much use logically connected abstractors will be: see <a
    href="../c13/s1.html">Chapter 13</a>.</p>

    <p>A ``nai'' attached to a non-logical connective (of selma'o
    JOI or BIhI) is a scalar negation, and says that the bridi is
    false under the specified mixture, but that another connective
    is applicable. Non-logical connectives are discussed in <a
    href="../c14/s1.html">Chapter 14</a>.</p>
