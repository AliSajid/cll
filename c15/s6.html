    <h3><a id="s6" name="s6">6. sumti negation</h3>

    <p>There are two ways of negating sumti in Lojban. We have the
    choice of quantifying the sumti with zero, or of applying the
    sumti-negator ``na'ebo'' before the sumti. It turns out that a
    zero quantification serves for contradictory negation. As the
    cmavo we use implies, ``na'ebo'' forms a scalar negation.</p>

    <p>Let us show examples of each.</p>
<pre>
<a id="e6d1" name="e6d1">6.1)</a>  no lo ca nolraitru
        be le fasygu'e cu krecau
    Zero of those who are currently noblest-governors
        of the French country are-hair-without.
    No current king of France is bald.
</pre>

    <p>Is <a href="#e6d1">Example 6.1</a> true? Yes, because it
    merely claims that of the current Kings of France, however many
    there may be, none are bald, which is plainly true, since there
    are no such current Kings of France.</p>

    <p>Now let us look at the same sentence using ``na'ebo''
    negation:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e6d2" name="e6d2">6.2)</a>  na'ebo lo ca nolraitru
        be le fasygu'e cu krecau
    [Something] other-than-(the-current-noblest-governor
        of the French country) is-hair-without.
    Something other than the current King of France is bald.
</pre>
    <a href="#e6d2">Example 6.2</a> is true provided that something
    reasonably describable as ``other than a current King of
    France'', such as the King of Saudi Arabia, or a former King of
    France, is in fact bald. 

    <p>In place of ``na'ebo'', you may also use ``no'ebo'' and
    ``to'ebo'', to be more specific about the sumti which would be
    appropriate in place of the stated sumti. Good examples are
    hard to come by, but here's a valiant try:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e6d3" name="e6d3">6.3)</a>  mi klama to'ebo la bastn.
    I go to the-opposite-of Boston.
    I go to Perth.
</pre>
    (Boston and Perth are nearly, but not quite, antipodal cities.
    In a purely United States context, San Francisco might be a
    better ``opposite''.) Coming up with good examples is
    difficult, because attaching ``to'ebo'' to a description sumti
    is usually the same as attaching ``to'e'' to the selbri of the
    description. 

    <p>It is not possible to transform sumti negations of either
    type into bridi negations or scalar selbri negations. Negations
    of sumti will be used in Lojban conversation. The inability to
    manipulate these negations logically will, it is hoped, prevent
    the logical errors that result when natural languages attempt
    corresponding manipulations.</p>
