      <h2>Chapter 15<br />
      ``No'' Problems: On Lojban Negation</h2>

          <h3><a id="s1" name="s1">1. Introductory</h3>

    <p>The grammatical expression of negation is a critical part of
    Lojban's claim to being logical. The problem of negation,
    simply put, is to come up with a complete definition of the
    word ``not''. For Lojban's unambiguous grammar, this means
    further that meanings of ``not'' with different grammatical
    effect must be different words, and even different grammatical
    structures.</p>

    <p>Logical assertions are implicitly required in a logical
    language; thus, an apparatus for expressing them is built into
    Lojban's logical connectives and other structures.</p>

    <p>In natural languages, especially those of Indo-European
    grammar, we have sentences composed of two parts which are
    typically called ``subject'' and ``predicate''. In the
    statement</p>
<pre>
<a id="e1d1" name="e1d1">1.1)</a>  John goes to the store
</pre>
    ``John'' is the subject, and ``goes to the store'' is the
    predicate. Negating <a href="#e1d1">Example 1.1</a> to produce 
<pre>
<a id="e1d2" name="e1d2">1.2)</a>  John doesn't go to the store.
</pre>
    has the effect of declaring that the predicate does not hold
    for the subject. <a href="#e1d2">Example 1.2</a> says nothing
    about whether John goes somewhere else, or whether someone else
    besides John goes to the store. 

    <p>We will call this kind of negation ``natural language
    negation''. This kind of negation is difficult to manipulate by
    the tools of logic, because it doesn't always follow the rules
    of logic. Logical negation is bi-polar: either a statement is
    true, or it is false. If a statement is false, then its
    negation must be true. Such negation is termed contradictory
    negation.</p>

    <p>Let's look at some examples of how natural language negation
    can violate the rules of contradictory negation.</p>
<pre>
<a id="e1d3" name="e1d3">1.3)</a>  Some animals are not white.

<a id="e1d4" name="e1d4">1.4)</a>   Some animals are white.
</pre>

    <p>Both of these statements are true; yet one is apparently the
    negation of the other. Another example:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e1d5" name="e1d5">1.5)</a>  I mustn't go to the dance.

<a id="e1d6" name="e1d6">1.6)</a>   I must go to the dance.
</pre>

    <p>At first thought, <a href="#e1d5">Example 1.5</a> negates <a
    href="#e1d6">Example 1.6</a>. Thinking further, we realize that
    there is an intermediate state wherein I am permitted to go to
    the dance, but not obligated to do so. Thus, it is possible
    that both statements are false.</p>

    <p>Sometimes order is significant:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e1d7"
name="e1d7">1.7)</a>  The falling rock didn't kill Sam.

<a id="e1d8"
name="e1d8">1.8)</a>   Sam wasn't killed by the falling rock.
</pre>

    <p>Our minds play tricks on us with this one. Because <a
    href="#e1d7">Example 1.7</a> is written in what is called the
    ``active voice'', we immediately get confused about whether
    ``the falling rock'' is a suitable subject for the predicate
    ``did kill Sam''. ``Kill'' implies volition to us, and rocks do
    not have volition. This confusion is employed by opponents of
    gun control who use the argument ``Guns don't kill people;
    people kill people.''</p>

    <p>Somehow, we don't have the same problem with <a
    href="#e1d8">Example 1.8</a>. The subject is Sam, and we
    determine the truth or falsity of the statement by whether he
    was or wasn't killed by the falling rock.</p>

    <p><a href="#e1d8">Example 1.8</a> also helps us focus on the
    fact that there are at least two questionable facts implicit in
    this sentence: whether Sam was killed, and if so, whether the
    falling rock killed him. If Sam wasn't killed, the question of
    what killed him is moot.</p>

    <p>This type of problem becomes more evident when the subject
    of the sentence turns out not to exist:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e1d9"
name="e1d9">1.9)</a>  The King of Mexico didn't come to dinner.

<a id="e1d10"
name="e1d10">1.10)</a> The King of Mexico did come to dinner.
</pre>

    <p>In the natural languages, we would be inclined to say that
    both of these statements are false, since there is no King of
    Mexico.</p>

    <p>The rest of this chapter is designed to explain the Lojban
    model of negation.</p>
