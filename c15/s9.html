          <h3><a id="s9" name="s9">9. Affirmations</h3>

    <p>There is an explicit positive form for both selma'o NA
    (``ja'a'') and selma'o NAhE (``je'a''), each of which would
    supplant the corresponding negator in the grammatical position
    used, allowing one to assert the positive in response to a
    negative question or statement without confusion. Assuming the
    same context as in <a href="#s8">Section 8</a>:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e9d1" name="e9d1">9.1)</a>  xu na go'i
    Is-it-true-that [false] [repeat previous]?
</pre>
    or equivalently 
<pre>
<a id="e9d2" name="e9d2">9.2)</a>  xu la djan. [cu] na pu klama
        la paris. .e la rom.
    Is it true that: John [false] previously-went-to
        [both] Paris and Rome.]
</pre>

    <p>The obvious, but incorrect, positive response to this
    negative question is:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e9d3" name="e9d3">9.3)</a>  go'i
    [repeat previous]
</pre>

    <p>A plain ``go'i'' does not mean ``Yes it is''; it merely
    abbreviates repeating the previous statement unmodified,
    including any negators present; and <a href="#e9d3">Example
    9.3</a> actually states that it is false that John went to both
    Paris and Rome.</p>

    <p>When considering:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e9d4" name="e9d4">9.4)</a>  na go'i
    [false] [repeat previous]
</pre>
    as a response to a negative question like <a
    href="#e9d2">Example 9.2</a>, Lojban designers had to choose
    between two equally plausible interpretations with opposite
    effects. Does <a href="#e9d4">Example 9.4</a> create a double
    negative in the sentence by adding a new ``na'' to the one
    already there (forming a double negative and hence a positive
    statement), or does the ``na'' replace the previous one,
    leaving the sentence unchanged? 

    <p>It was decided that substitution, the latter alternative, is
    the preferable choice, since it is then clear whether we intend
    a positive or a negativ sentence without performing any
    manipulations. This is the way English usually works, but not
    all languages work this way --- Russian, Japanese, and Navajo
    all interpret a negative reply to a negative question as
    positive.</p>

    <p>The positive assertion cmavo of selma'o NA can also replace
    the ``na'' in the context, giving:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e9d5" name="e9d5">9.5)</a>  ja'a go'i
    (John truly-(previously went-to) [both] Paris and Rome.)
</pre>
    ``ja'a'' can replace ``na'' in a similar manner wherever the
    latter is used: 
<pre>
<a id="e9d6" name="e9d6">9.6)</a>  ja'a go'i
    John indeed previously went-to [both] Paris and Rome.
</pre>
    ``je'a'' can replace ``na'e'' in exactly the same way, stating
    that scalar negation does not apply, and that the relation
    indeed holds as stated. In the absence of a negation context,
    it emphasizes the positive: 
<pre>
<a id="e9d7" name="e9d7">9.7)</a>  ta je'a melbi
    that is-indeed beautiful.
</pre>
