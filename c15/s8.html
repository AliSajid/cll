    <h3><a id="s8" name="s8">8. Truth questions</h3>

    <p>One application of negation is in answer to truth questions
    (those which expect the answers ``Yes'' or ``No''). The truth
    question cmavo ``xu'' is in selma'o UI; placed at the beginning
    of a sentence, it asks whether the sentence as a whole is true
    or false.</p>
<pre>
<a id="e8d1"
name="e8d1">8.1)</a>  xu la djan. pu klama la paris. .e la rom.
    Is it true that:
        (John previously went-to [both] Paris and Rome.)
</pre>

    <p>You can now use each of the several kinds of negation we've
    discussed in answer to this (presuming the same question and
    context for each answer).</p>

    <p>The straightforward negative answer is grammatically
    equivalent to the expanded sentence with the ``na'' immediately
    after the ``cu'' (and before any tense/modal):</p>
<pre>
<a id="e8d2" name="e8d2">8.2)</a>  na go'i
    [false] [repeat previous]
    No.
</pre>
    which means 
<pre>
<a id="e8d3"
name="e8d3">8.3)</a>  la djan. [cu] na pu klama la paris. .e la rom.
    John [false] previously went-to [both] Paris and Rome.
    It's not true that John went to Paris and Rome.
</pre>

    <p>The respondent can change the tense, putting the ``na'' in
    either before or after the new tense:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e8d4" name="e8d4">8.4)</a>  na ba go'i
    [false] [future] [repeat previous]
</pre>
    meaning 
<pre>
<a id="e8d5"
name="e8d5">8.5)</a>  la djan. [cu] na ba klama la paris. .e la rom.
    John [false] later-will-go-to [both] Paris and Rome.
    It is false that John will go to Paris and Rome.
</pre>
    or alternatively 
<pre>
<a id="e8d6" name="e8d6">8.6)</a>  ba na go'i
    [false] [future] [repeat previous]
</pre>
    meaning 
<pre>
<a id="e8d7"
name="e8d7">8.7)</a>  la djan. [cu] ba na klama la paris. .e la rom.
    John later-will [false] go-to [both] Paris and Rome.
</pre>

    <p>We stated in <a href="s3.html">Section 3</a> that sentences like
    <a href="#e8d5">Example 8.5</a> and <a href="#e8d7">Example
    8.7</a> appear to be semantically identical, but that subtle
    semantic distinctions may eventually be found.</p>

    <p>You can also use a scalar negation with ``na'e'', in which
    case, it is equivalent to putting a ``na'eke'' immediately
    after any tense:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e8d8" name="e8d8">8.8)</a>  na'e go'i
    other-than [repeat previous]
</pre>
    which means 
<pre>
<a id="e8d9" name="e8d9">8.9)</a>  la djan. [cu] pu na'eke klama
        [ke'e] la paris. .e la rom.
    John previously other-than(went-to)
        [both] Paris and Rome.
</pre>

    <p>He might have telephoned the two cities instead of going
    there. The unnecessary ``ke'' and ``ke'e'' would have been
    essential if the selbri had been a tanru.</p>
