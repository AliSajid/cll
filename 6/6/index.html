          <h3>6. Quantified sumti</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   ro  PA  all of/each of
    su'o    PA  at least (one of)
</pre>
    Quantifiers tell us how many: in the case of quantifiers with
    sumti, how many things we are talking about. In Lojban,
    quantifiers are expressed by numbers and mathematical
    expressions: a large topic discussed in some detail in <a
    href="../../18/1/">Chapter 18</a>. For the purposes of this
    chapter, a simplified treatment will suffice. Our examples will
    employ either the simple Lojban numbers ``pa'', ``re'', ``ci'',
    ``vo'', and ``mu'', meaning ``one'', ``two'', ``three'',
    ``four'', ``five'' respectively, or else one of four special
    quantifiers, two of which are discussed in this section and
    listed above. These four quantifiers are important because
    every Lojban sumti has either one or two of them implicitly
    present in it --- which one or two depends on the particular
    kind of sumti. There is more explanation of implicit
    quantifiers later in this section. (The other two quantifiers,
    ``piro'' and ``pisu'o'', are explained in <a href=../7/>Section
    7</a>.) 

    <p>Every Lojban sumti may optionally be preceded by an explicit
    quantifier. The purpose of this quantifier is to specify how
    many of the things referred to by the sumti are being talked
    about. Here are some simple examples contrasting sumti with and
    without explicit quantifiers:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">6.1)</a>  do cadzu le bisli
    You walk-on the ice.

<a id="2" name="2">6.2)</a>   re do cadzu le bisli
    Two-of you walk-on the ice.
</pre>
    The difference between <a href="../6/#1">Example 6.1</a> and <a
    href="../6/#2">Example 6.2</a> is the presence of the explicit
    quantifier ``re'' in the latter example. Although ``re'' by
    itself means ``two'', when used as a quantifier it means
    ``two-of''. Out of the group of listeners (the number of which
    isn't stated), two (we are not told which ones) are asserted to
    be ``walkers on the ice''. Implicitly, the others (if any) are
    not walkers on the ice. In Lojban, you cannot say ``I own three
    shoes'' if in fact you own four shoes. Numbers need never be
    specified, but if they are specified they must be correct. 

    <p>(This rule does not mean that there is no way to specify a
    number which is vague. The sentence</p>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">6.3)</a>  mi ponse su'o ci cutci
    I possess at-least three shoes.
</pre>
    is true if you own three shoes, or four, or indeed any larger
    number. More details on vague numbers appear in the discussion
    of mathematical expressions in <a href="../../18/1/">Chapter
    18</a>.) 

    <p>Now consider <a href="../6/#1">Example 6.1</a> again. How many
    of the listeners are claimed to walk on the ice? The answer
    turns out to be: all of them, however many that is. So <a
    href="../6/#1">Example 6.1</a> and <a href="../6/#4">Example
    6.4</a>:</p>
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">6.4)</a>  ro do cadzu le bisli
    All-of you walk-on the ice.
</pre>
    turn out to mean exactly the same thing. This is a safe
    strategy, because if one of my listeners doesn't turn out to be
    walking on the ice, I can safely claim that I didn't intend
    that person to be a listener! And in fact, all of the personal
    pro-sumti such as ``mi'' and ``mi'o'' and ``ko'' obey the same
    rule. We say that personal pro-sumti have a so-called
    ``implicit quantifier'' of ``ro'' (all). This just means that
    if no quantifier is given explicitly, the meaning is the same
    as if the implicit quantifier had been used. 

    <p>Not all sumti have ``ro'' as the implicit quantifier,
    however. Consider the quotation in:</p>
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">6.5)</a>  mi cusku lu do cadzu le bisli li'u
    I express [quote] you walk-on the ice [unquote].
    I say, ``You walk on the ice.''
</pre>

    <p>What is the implicit quantifier of the quotation ``lu do
    cadzu le bisli li'u''? Surely not ``ro''. If ``ro'' were
    supplied explicitly, thus:</p>
<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">6.6)</a>  mi cusku ro lu do cadzu le bisli li'u
    I express all-of [quote] you walk-on the ice [unquote].
</pre>
    the meaning would be something like ``I say every occurrence of
    the sentence 'You walk on the ice'''. Of course I don't say
    every occurrence of it, only some occurrences. One might
    suppose that <a href="../6/#5">Example 6.5</a> means that I
    express exactly one occurrence, but it is more Lojbanic to
    leave the number unspecified, as with other sumti. We can say
    definitely, however, that I say it at least once. 

    <p>The Lojban cmavo meaning ``at least'' is ``su'o'', and if no
    ordinary number follows, ``su'o'' means ``at least once''. (See
    <a href="../6/#3">Example 6.3</a> for the use of ``su'o'' with an
    ordinary number). Therefore, the explicitly quantified version
    of <a href="../6/#5">Example 6.5</a> is</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">6.7)</a>  mi cusku su'o lu do cadzu
        le bisli li'u
    I express at-least-one-of [quote] you walk-on
        the ice [unquote].
    I say one or more instances of ``You walk on the ice''.
    I say ``You walk on the ice''.
</pre>

    <p>If an explicit ordinary number such as ``re'' were to
    appear, it would have to convey an exact expression, so</p>
<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">6.8)</a>  mi cusku re lu do cadzu le bisli li'u
    I express two-of [quote] you walk-on the ice [unquote].
</pre>
    means that I say the sentence exactly twice, neither more nor
    less.
