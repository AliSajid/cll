          <h3>11. The syntax of vocative phrases</h3>

    <p>Vocative phrases are not sumti, but are explained in this
    chapter because their syntax is very similar to that of sumti.
    Grammatically, a vocative phrase is one of the so-called “free
    modifiers” of Lojban, along with subscripts, parentheses, and
    various other constructs explained in <a
    href="../../19/1/">Chapter 19</a>. They can be placed after
    many, but not all, constructions of the grammar: in general,
    after any elidable terminator (which, however, must not then be
    elided!), at the beginnings and ends of sentences, and in many
    other places.</p>

    <p>The purpose of a vocative phrase is to indicate who the
    person being addressed is, or to indicate to that person that
    he or she ought to be listening. A vocative phrase begins with
    a cmavo of selma'o COI or DOI, all of which are explained in
    more detail in <a href="../../13/1/">Chapter 13</a>. Sometimes
    that is all there is to the phrase:</p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">11.1)</a>    coi
    [greetings]
    Hello.

<a id="2" name="2">11.2)</a> je'e
    [acknowledgement]
    Uh-huh.
    Roger!
</pre>
    In these cases, the person being addressed is obvious from the
    context. However, a vocative word (more precisely, one or more
    cmavo of COI, possibly followed by “doi”, or else just
    “doi” by itself) can be followed by one of several kinds of
    phrases, all of which are intended to indicate the addressee.
    The most common case is a name: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="11-2.5" name="11-2.5">11.2.5)</a>    coi. djan.
    Hello, John.
</pre>

    <p>A pause is required (for morphological reasons) between a
    member of COI and a name. You can use “doi” instead of a
    pause:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">11.3)</a>    coi doi djan.
    Hello, John.
</pre>
    means exactly the same thing and does not require a pause.
    Using “doi” by itself is like just saying someone's name to
    attract his or her attention: 
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">11.4)</a>    doi djan.
    John!
</pre>
    In place of a name, a description may appear, lacking its
    descriptor, which is understood to be “le”: 
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">11.5)</a>    coi xunre pastu nixli
    Hello, (red-type-of dress)-type-of girl.
    Hello, girl with the red dress!
</pre>
    The listener need not really be a “xunre pastu nixli”, as
    long as she understands herself correctly from the description.
    (Actually, only a bare selbri can appear; explicit quantifiers
    are forbidden in this form of vocative, so the implicit
    quantifiers “su'o le ro” are in effect.) 

    <p>Finally, a complete sumti may be used, the most general
    case.</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">11.6)</a>    co'o la bab. .e la noras.
    Goodbye, Bob and Nora.
</pre>
    <a href="../11/#5">Example 11.5</a> is thus the same as: 
<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">11.7)</a>    coi le xunre pastu nixli
    Hello, the-one-described-as red-dress girl!
</pre>
    and <a href="../11/#4">Example 11.4</a> is the same as: 
<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">11.8)</a>    doi la djan.
    The-one-named John!
</pre>
    Finally, the elidable terminator for vocative phrases is
    “do'u” (of selma'o DOhU), which is rarely needed except when
    a simple vocative word is being placed somewhere within a
    bridi. It may also be required when a vocative is placed
    between a sumti and its relative clause, or when there are a
    sequence of so-called “free modifiers” (vocatives,
    subscripts, utterance ordinals --- see <a
    href="../../18/1/">Chapter 18</a> --- metalinguistic comments
    --- see <a href="../../19/1/">Chapter 19</a> --- or reciprocals
    --- see <a href="../../19/1/">Chapter 19</a>) which must be
    properly separated. 

    <p>The meaning of a vocative phrase that is within a sentence
    is not affected by its position in the sentence: thus <a
    href="../11/#9">Example 11.9</a> and <a href="../11/#10">Example
    11.10</a> mean the same thing:</p>
<pre>
<a id="9" name="9">11.9)</a>    doi djan. ko klama mi
    John, come to me!

<a id="10" name="10">11.10)</a>   ko klama mi doi djan.
    Come to me, John!
</pre>

    <p>As usual for this chapter, the full syntax of vocative
    phrases has not been explained: relative clauses, discussed in
    <a href="../../8/1/">Chapter 8</a>, make for more
    possibilities.</p>
