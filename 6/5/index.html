          <h3>5. Descriptors for typical objects</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<pre>
     lo'e    LE                  the typical
     le'e    LE                  the stereotypical
</pre>
</p>

    <p>As promised in <a href=../3/>Section 3</a>, Lojban has a method
    for discriminating between “the lion” who lives in Africa and
    “the Englishman” who, generally speaking, doesn’t live in
    Africa even though some Englishmen do. The descriptor “lo'e”
    means “the typical”, as in

<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">5.1)</a>  lo'e cinfo cu xabju le fi'ortu'a
     The-typical lion dwells-in the African-land.
     The lion dwells in Africa.
</pre>

    What is this “typical lion”? Surely it is not any particular
    lion, because no lion has all of the “typical”
    characteristics, and (worse yet) some characteristics that all
    real lions have can’t be viewed as typical. For example, all
    real lions are either male or female, but it would be bizarre
    to suppose that the typical lion is either one. So the typical
    lion has no particular sex, but does have a color (golden
    brown), a residence (Africa), a diet (game), and so on.
    Likewise we can say that

<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">5.2)</a>  lo'e glinanmu cu xabju le fi'ortu'a na.e le gligugde
     The-typical English-man dwells-in the African-land (Not!) and the English-country.
     The typical Englishman dwells not in Africa but in England.
</pre>

    The relationship between “lo'e cinfo” and “lo'i cinfo” may
    be explained thus: the typical lion is an imaginary
    lion-abstraction which best exemplifies the set of lions. There
    is a similar relationship between “le'e” and “le'i”:

<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">5.3)</a>  le'e xelso merko cu gusta ponse
     The-stereotypical Greek-type-of American is-a-restaurant-type-of owner.
     Lots of Greek-Americans own restaurants.
</pre>

    Here we are concerned not with the actual set of
    Greek-Americans, but with the set of those the speaker has in
    mind, which is typified by one (real or imaginary) who owns a
    restaurant. The word “stereotypical” is often derogatory in
    English, but “le'e” need not be derogatory in Lojban: it
    simply suggests that the example is typical in the speaker’s
    imagination rather than in some objectively agreed-upon way. Of
    course, different speakers may disagree about what the features
    of “the typical lion” are (some would include having a short
    intestine, whereas others would know nothing of lions’
    intestines), so the distinction between “lo'e cinfo” and
    “le'e cinfo” may be very fine.</p>

    <p>Furthermore,

<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">5.4)</a>  le'e skina cu se finti ne'i la xali,uyd.
     The-stereotypical movie is-invented in Hollywood.
</pre>

    is probably true to an American, but might be false (not the
    stereotype) to someone living in India or Russia.</p>

    <p>Note that there is no naming equivalent of “lo'e” and
    “le'e”, because there is no need, as a rule, for a “typical
    George” or a “typical Smith”. People or things who share a
    common name do not, in general, have any other common
    attributes worth mentioning.</p>
