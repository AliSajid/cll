          <h3>2. The three basic description types</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:

<pre>
     le      LE                  the, the one(s) described as
     lo      LE                  some, some of those which really are
     la      LA                  the one(s) named
     ku      KU                  elidable terminator for LE, LA
</pre>
</p>

    <p>The syntax of descriptions is fairly complex, and not all of it
    can be explained within the confines of this chapter: relative
    clauses, in particular, are discussed in <a
    href="../../8/1/">Chapter 8</a>. However, most descriptions
    have just two components: a descriptor belonging to selma'o LE
    or LA, and a selbri. (The difference between selma'o LE and
    selma'o LA is not important until <a href=../12/>Section
    12</a>.) Furthermore, the selbri is often just a single brivla.
    Here is an elementary example: 

<pre>
<a name="Example1">2.1)</a>   le zarci
       one-or-more-specific-things-each-of-which-I-describe-as being-a-market
       the market
</pre>

    The long gloss for “le” is of course far too long to use most
    of the time, and in fact “le” is quite close in meaning to
    English “the”. It has particular implications, however, which
    “the” does not have.</p> 

    <p>The general purpose of all descriptors is to create a sumti
    which might occur in the x1 place of the selbri belonging to
    the description. Thus “le zarci” conveys something which
    might be found in the x1 place of “zarci”, namely a
    market.</p>

    <p>The specific purpose of “le” is twofold. First, it
    indicates that the speaker has one or more specific markets in
    mind (whether or not the listener knows which ones they are).
    Second, it also indicates that the speaker is merely describing
    the things he or she has in mind as markets, without being
    committed to the truth of that description.

<pre>
<a name="Example2">2.2)</a>   le zarci cu barda
       One-or-more-specific-things-which-I-describe as “markets” is/are-big.
       The market is big.
       The markets are big.
</pre>

    Note that English-speakers must state whether a reference to
    markets is to just one (“the market”) or to more than one
    (“the markets”). Lojban requires no such forced choice, so
    both colloquial translations of <a href="../2/#2">Example 2.2</a>
    are valid. Only the context can specify which is meant. (This
    rule does not mean that Lojban has no way of specifying the
    number of markets in such a case: that mechanism is explained
    in <a href=../7/>Section 7</a>.)</p> 

    <p>Now consider the following strange-looking example:

<pre>
<a name="Example3">2.3)</a>   le nanmu cu ninmu
       One-or-more-specific-things-which-I-describe as “men” are women.
       The man is a woman.
       The men are women.
</pre>

    <a href="../2/#3">Example 2.3</a> is not self-contradictory in
    Lojban, because “le nanmu” merely means something or other
    which, for my present purposes, I choose to describe as a man,
    whether or not it really is a man. A plausible instance would
    be: someone we had assumed to be a man at a distance turned out
    to be actually a woman on closer observation. <a
    href="../2/#3">Example 2.3</a> is what I would say to point out
    my observation to you.</p>

    <p>In all descriptions with “le”, the listener is presumed to
    either know what I have in mind or else not to be concerned at
    present (perhaps I will give more identifying details later).
    In particular, I might be pointing at the supposed man or men:
    <a href="../2/#3">Example 2.3</a> would then be perfectly
    intelligible, since “le nanmu” merely clarifies that I am
    pointing at the supposed man, not at a landscape, or a nose,
    which happens to lie in the same direction.</p>

    <p>The second descriptor dealt with in this section is “lo”.
    Unlike “le”, “lo” is nonspecific:

<pre>
<a name="Example4">2.4)</a>   lo zarci
       one-or-more-of-all-the-things-which-really are-markets
       a market
       some markets
</pre>

    Again, there are two colloquial English translations. The
    effect of using “lo” in <a href="../2/#4">Example 2.4</a> is to
    refer generally to one or more markets, without being specific
    about which. Unlike “le zarci”, “lo zarci” must refer to
    something which actually is a market (that is, which can appear
    in the x1 place of a truthful bridi whose selbri is “zarci”).
    Thus 

<pre>
<a name="Example5">2.5)</a>   lo nanmu cu ninmu
       Some man is a woman.
       Some men are women.
</pre>

    must be false in Lojban, given that there are no objects in the
    real world which are both men and women. Pointing at some
    specific men or women would not make <a href="../2/#5">Example
    2.5</a> true, because those specific individuals are no more
    both-men-and-women than any others. In general, “lo” refers
    to whatever individuals meet its description.</p> 

    <p>The last descriptor of this section is “la”, which
    indicates that the selbri which follows it has been dissociated
    from its normal meaning and is being used as a name. Like
    “le” descriptions, “la” descriptions are implicitly
    restricted to those I have in mind. (Do not confuse this use of
    “la” with its use before regular Lojbanized names, which is
    discussed in <a href=../12/>Section 12</a>.) For example:

<pre>
<a name="Example6">2.6)</a>   la cribe pu finti le lisri
       The-one-named “bear” [past] creates the story.
       Bear wrote the story.
</pre>

    In <a href="../2/#6">Example 2.6</a>, “la cribe” refers to
    someone whose naming predicate is “cribe”, i.e. “Bear”. In
    English, most names don’t mean anything, or at least not
    anything obvious. The name “Frank” coincides with the English
    word “frank”, meaning “honest”, and so one way of
    translating “Frank ate some cheese” into Lojban would be: 

<pre>
<a name="Example7">2.7)</a>   la stace pu citka lo cirla
       The-one-called “Honest/Frank” [past] eats some cheese.
</pre>

    English-speakers typically would not do this, as we tend to
    be more attached to the sound of our names than their meaning,
    even if the meaning (etymological or current) is known.
    Speakers of other languages may feel differently. (In point of
    fact, “Frank” originally meant “the free one” rather than
    “the honest one”.)</p>

    <p>It is important to note the differences between <a
    href="../2/#6">Example 2.6</a> and the following:

<pre>
<a name="Example8">2.8)</a>   le cribe pu finti le lisri
       One-or-more-specific-things-which-I-describe-as a-bear [past] creates the story.
       The bear(s) wrote the story.
</pre>

<pre>
<a name="Example9">2.9)</a>   lo cribe pu finti le lisri
       One-or-more-of-the-things-which-really are-bears [past] creates the story.
       A bear wrote the story.
       Some bears wrote the story.
</pre>

    <a href="../2/#8">Example 2.8</a> is about a specific bear or
    bearlike thing(s), or thing(s) which the speaker (perhaps
    whimsically or metaphorically) describes as a bear (or more
    than one); <a href="../2/#9">Example 2.9</a> is about one or more
    of the really existing, objectively defined bears. In either
    case, though, each of them must have contributed to the writing
    of the story, if more than one bear (or “bear”) is meant.</p> 

    <p>(The notion of a “really existing, objectively defined
    bear” raises certain difficulties. Is a panda bear a “real
    bear”? How about a teddy bear? In general, the answer is
    “yes”. Lojban gismu are defined as broadly as possible,
    allowing tanru and lujvo to narrow down the definition. There
    probably are no necessary and sufficient conditions for
    defining what is and what is not a bear that can be pinned down
    with complete precision: the real world is fuzzy. In borderline
    cases, “le” may communicate better than “lo”.)</p>

    <p>So while <a href="../2/#6">Example 2.6</a> could easily be
    true (there is a real writer named “Greg Bear”), and <a
    href="../2/#8">Example 2.8</a> could be true if the speaker is
    sufficiently peculiar in what he or she describes as a bear, <a
    href="../2/#9">Example 2.9</a> is certainly false.</p>

    <p>Similarly, compare the following two examples, which are
    analogous to <a href="../2/#8">Example 2.8</a> and <a
    href="../2/#9">Example 2.9</a> respectively:

<pre>
<a name="Example10">2.10)</a>  le remna pu finti le lisri
       The human being(s) wrote the story.

<a name="Example11">2.11)</a>  lo remna pu finti le lisri
       A human being wrote the story.
       Some human beings wrote the story.
</pre>

    <a href="../2/#10">Example 2.10</a> says who the author of the
    story is: one or more particular human beings that the speaker
    has in mind. If the topic of conversation is the story, then <a
    href="../2/#10">Example 2.10</a> identifies the author as someone
    who can be pointed out or who has been previously mentioned;
    whereas if the topic is a person, then “le remna” is in
    effect a shorthand reference to that person. <a
    href="../2/#11">Example 2.11</a> merely says that the author is
    human.</p>

    <p>The elidable terminator for all descriptions is “ku”. It
    can almost always be omitted with no danger of ambiguity. The
    main exceptions are in certain uses of relative clauses, which
    are discussed in <a href="../../8/1/">Chapter 8</a>, and in the
    case of a description immediately preceding the selbri. In this
    latter case, using an explicit “cu” before the selbri makes
    the “ku” unnecessary. There are also a few other uses of
    “ku”: in the compound negator “naku” (discussed in <a
    href="../../15/1/">Chapter 15</a>) and to terminate
    place-structure, tense, and modal tags that do not have
    associated sumti (discussed in <a href="../../9/1/">Chapter
    9</a> and <a href="../../10/1/">Chapter 10</a>).</p>
