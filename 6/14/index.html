          <h3>14. Quotation summary</h3>

    <p>There are four kinds of quotation in Lojban: text quotation,
    words quotation, single-word quotation, non-Lojban quotation.
    More information is provided in <a href="../../19/1/">Chapter
    19</a>.</p>

    <p>Text quotations are preceded by ``lu'' and followed by
    ``li'u'', and are an essential part of the surrounding text:
    they must be grammatical Lojban texts.</p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">14.1)</a>    mi cusku lu mi'e djan. li'u
    I say the-text [quote] I-am John [unquote].
    I say ``I'm John''.
</pre>
    Words quotations are quotations of one or more Lojban words.
    The words need not mean anything, but they must be
    morphologically valid so that the end of the quotation can be
    discerned. 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">14.2)</a>    mi cusku lo'u li mi le'u
    I say the-words [quote] ``li mi'' [unquote].
    I say ``li mi''.
</pre>

    <p>Note that the translation of <a href="../14/#2">Example
    14.2</a> does not translate the Lojban words, because they are
    not presumed to have any meaning (in fact, they are
    ungrammatical).</p>

    <p>Single-word quotation quotes a single Lojban word. Compound
    cmavo are not allowed.</p>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">14.3)</a>    mi cusku zo .ai
    I say the-word ``.ai''.
</pre>
    Non-Lojban quotation can quote anything, Lojban or not, even
    non-speech such as drum talk, whistle words, music, or
    belching. A Lojban word which does not appear within the
    quotation is used before and after it to set it off from the
    surrounding Lojban text. 
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">14.4)</a>    mi cusku zoi kuot. I'm John .kuot
    I say ``I'm John''.
</pre>
    The implicit quantifier for all types of quotation is ``su'o''
    (at least one), because quotations are analogous to ``lo''
    descriptions: they refer to things which actually are words or
    sequences of words.
