          <h3>15. Number summary</h3>

    <p>The sumti which refer to numbers consist of the cmavo “li”
    (of selma'o LI) followed by an arbitrary Lojban mekso, or
    mathematical expression. This can be anything from a simple
    number up to the most complicated combination of numbers,
    variables, operators, and so on. Much more information on
    numbers is given in <a href="../../18/1/">Chapter 18</a>. Here
    are a few examples of increasing complexity:

<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">15.1)</a>  li vo
       the-number four
       4

<a id="2" name="2">15.2)</a>  li re su'i re
       the-number two plus two
       2 + 2

<a id="3" name="3">15.3)</a>  li .abu bopi'i xy. bote'a re su'i by. bopi'i xy. su'i cy.
       the-number a times x to-power 2 plus b times x plus c
       ax<sup>2</sup>  + bx + c
</pre>
</p>

    <p>An alternative to “li” is “me'o”, also of selma'o LI.
    Number expressions beginning with “me'o” refer to the actual
    expression, rather than its value. Thus <a
    href="../15/#1">Example 15.1</a> and <a href="../15/#2">Example
    15.2</a> above have the same meaning, the number four, whereas 

<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">15.4)</a>  me'o vo
       the-expression four
       “4”
</pre>

    and 

<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">15.5)</a>  me'o re su'i re
       the-expression two plus two
       “2+2”
</pre>

    refer to different pieces of text.</p>

    <p>The implicit quantifier for numbers and mathematical
    expressions is “su'o”, because these sumti are analogous to
    “lo” descriptions: they refer to things which actually are
    numbers or pieces of text. In the case of numbers (with
    “li”), this is a distinction without a difference, as there
    is only one number which is 4; but there are many texts “4”,
    as many as there are documents in which that numeral
    appears.</p>
