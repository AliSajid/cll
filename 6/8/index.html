          <h3><a id="8" name="8">8. Indefinite descriptions</h3>

    <p>By a quirk of Lojban syntax, it is possible to omit the
    descriptor ``lo'', but never any other descriptor, from a
    description like that of <a href="../7/#5">Example 7.5</a>;
    namely, one which has an explicit outer quantifier but no
    explicit inner quantifier. The following example:</p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">8.1)</a>  ci gerku [ku] cu blabi
    Three dogs are white.
</pre>
    is equivalent in meaning to <a href="../7/#5">Example 7.5</a>.
    Even though the descriptor is not present, the elidable
    terminator ``ku'' may still be used. The name ``indefinite
    description'' for this syntactic form is historically based: of
    course, it is no more and no less indefinite than its
    counterpart with an explicit ``lo''. Indefinite descriptions
    were introduced into the language in order to imitate the
    syntax of English and other natural languages. 

    <p>Indefinite descriptions must fit this mold exactly: there is
    no way to make one which does not have an explicit outer
    quantifier (thus ``*gerku cu blabi'' is ungrammatical), or
    which has an explicit inner quantifier (thus ``*reboi ci gerku
    cu blabi'' is also ungrammatical --- ``re ci gerku cu blabi''
    is fine, but means ``23 dogs are white'').</p>

    <p>Note: <a href="../6/#3">Example 6.3</a> also contains an
    indefinite description, namely ``su'o ci cutci''; another
    version of that example using an explicit ``lo'' would be:</p>
<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">8.2)</a>  mi ponse su'o ci lo cutci
    I possess at-least three things-which-really-are shoes
    I own three (or more) shoes.
</pre>
