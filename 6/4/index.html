          <h3>4. Masses and sets</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
    le'i    LE  the set described as
    lo'i    LE  the set of those which really are
    la'i    LA  the set of those named
</pre>
    Having said so much about masses, let us turn to sets. Sets are
    easier to understand than masses, but are more rarely used.
    Like a mass, a set is an abstract object formed from a number
    of individuals; however, the properties of a set are not
    derived from any of the properties of the individuals that
    compose it.

    <p>Sets have properties like cardinality (how many elements in
    the set), membership (the relationship between a set and its
    elements), and set inclusion (the relationship between two
    sets, one of which --- the superset -- contains all the
    elements of the other --- the subset). The set descriptors
    “le'i”, “lo'i” and “la'i” correspond exactly to the mass
    descriptors “lei”, “loi”, and “lai” except that normally
    we talk of the whole of a set, not just part of it. Here are
    some examples contrasting “lo”, “loi”, and “lo'i”:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">4.1)</a>  lo ratcu cu bunre
    one-or-more-of-those-which-really-are rats are-brown.
    Some rats are brown.

<a id="2" name="2">4.2)</a>   loi ratcu cu cmalu
    part-of-the-mass-of-those-which-really-are rats are-small.
    Rats are small.

<a id="3" name="3">4.3)</a>   lo'i ratcu cu barda
    The-set-of rats is-large.
    There are a lot of rats.
</pre>

    <p>The mass of rats is small because at least one rat is small;
    the mass of rats is also large; the set of rats, though, is
    unquestionably large -- it has billions of members. The mass of
    rats is also brown, since some of its components are; but it
    would be incorrect to call the set of rats brown --- brown-ness
    is not the sort of property that sets possess.</p>

    <p>Lojban speakers should generally think twice before
    employing the set descriptors. However, certain predicates have
    places that require set sumti to fill them. For example, the
    place structure of “fadni” is:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>x1 is ordinary/common/typical/usual in property x2 among
      the members of set x3</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Why is it necessary for the x3 place of “fadni” to be a
    set? Because it makes no sense for an individual to be typical
    of another individual: an individual is typical of a group. In
    order to make sure that the bridi containing “fadni” is about
    an entire group, its x3 place must be filled with a set:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">4.4)</a>  mi fadni fi lo'i lobypli
    I am-ordinary among the-set-of Lojban-users.
    I am a typical Lojban user.
</pre>

    <p>Note that the x2 place has been omitted; I am not specifying
    in exactly which way I am typical --- whether in language
    knowledge, or age, or interests, or something else. If “lo'i”
    were changed to “lo” in <a href="../4/#4">Example 4.4</a>, the
    meaning would be something like “I am typical of some Lojban
    user”, which is nonsense.</p>
