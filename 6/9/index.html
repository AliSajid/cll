          <h3>9. sumti-based descriptions</h3>

    <p>As stated in <a href=../2/>Section 2</a>, most descriptions
    consist of just a descriptor and a selbri. (In this chapter,
    the selbri have always been single gismu, but of course any
    selbri, however complex, can be employed in a description. The
    syntax and semantics of selbri are explained in <a
    href="../../5/1/">Chapter 5</a>.) In the intervening sections,
    inner and outer quantifiers have been added to the syntax. Now
    it is time to discuss a description of a radically different
    kind: the sumti-based description.</p>

    <p>A sumti-based description has a sumti where the selbri would
    normally be, and the inner quantifier is required --- it cannot
    be implicit. An outer quantifier is permitted but not
    required.</p>

    <p>A full theory of sumti-based descriptions has yet to be
    worked out. One common case, however, is well understood.
    Compare the following:</p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">9.1)</a>  re do cu nanmu
    Two-of you are-men.
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">9.2)</a>  le re do cu nanmu
    The two-of you are men.
</pre>
    <a href="../9/#1">Example 9.1</a> simply specifies that of the
    group of listeners, size unknown, two are men. <a
    href="../9/#2">Example 9.2</a>, which has the sumti-based
    description “le re do”, says that of the two listeners, all
    (the implicit outer quantifier “ro”) are men. So in effect
    the inner quantifier “re” gives the number of individuals
    which the inner sumti “do” refers to. 

    <p>Here is another group of examples:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">9.3)</a>  re le ci cribe cu bunre
    Two-of the three bears are-brown.

<a id="4" name="4">9.4)</a>   le re le ci cribe cu bunre
    The two-of the three bears are-brown.

<a id="5" name="5">9.5)</a>   pa le re le ci cribe cu bunre
    One-of the two-of the three bears are-brown.
</pre>
    In each case, “le ci cribe” restricts the bears (or alleged
    bears) being talked of to some group of three which the speaker
    has in mind. <a href="../9/#3">Example 9.3</a> says that two of
    them (which two is not stated) are brown. <a
    href="../9/#4">Example 9.4</a> says that a specific pair of them
    are brown. <a href="../9/#5">Example 9.5</a> says that of a
    specific pair chosen from the original three, one or the other
    of that pair is brown.
