      <h2>Chapter 18<br />
      lojbau mekso: Mathematical Expressions in Lojban</h2>

          <h3>1. Introductory</h3>
    lojbau mekso (“Lojbanic mathematical-expression”) is the part
    of the Lojban language that is tailored for expressing
    statements of a mathematical character, or for adding numerical
    information to non-mathematical statements. Its formal design
    goals include: 

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dt>1)</dt>

      <dd>representing all the different forms of expression used
      by mathematicians in their normal modes of writing, so that a
      reader can unambiguously read off mathematical text as
      written with minimal effort and expect a listener to
      understand it;</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>2)</dt>

      <dd>providing a vocabulary of commonly used mathematical
      terms which can readily be expanded to include newly coined
      words using the full resources of Lojban;</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>3)</dt>

      <dd>permitting the formulation, both in writing and in
      speech, of unambiguous mathematical text;</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>4)</dt>

      <dd>encompassing all forms of quantified expression found in
      natural languages, as well as encouraging greater precision
      in ordinary language situations than natural languages
      allow.</dd>
    </dl>
    Goal 1 requires that mekso not be constrained to a single
    notation such as Polish notation or reverse Polish notation,
    but make provision for all forms, with the most commonly used
    forms the most easily used. 

    <p>Goal 2 requires the provision of several conversion
    mechanisms, so that the boundary between mekso and full Lojban
    can be crossed from either side at many points.</p>

    <p>Goal 3 is the most subtle. Written mathematical expression
    is culturally unambiguous, in the sense that mathematicians in
    all parts of the world understand the same written texts to
    have the same meanings. However, international mathematical
    notation does not prescribe unique forms. For example, the
    expression</p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">1.1)</a>  3x + 2y
</pre>
    contains omitted multiplication operators, but there are other
    possible interpretations for the strings “3x” and “2y” than
    as mathematical multiplication. Therefore, the Lojban verbal
    (spoken and written) form of <a href="../1/#1">Example 1.1</a>
    must not omit the multiplication operators. 

    <p>The remainder of this chapter explains (in as much detail as
    is currently possible) the mekso system. This chapter is by
    intention complete as regards mekso components, but only
    suggestive about uses of those components --- as of now, there
    has been no really comprehensive use made of mekso facilities,
    and many matters must await the test of usage to be fully
    clarified.</p>
