To make the XHTML version (ends up in a dir named html/):

  make

This takes quite a while.  To do it for just one chapter for faster
testing:

  make test="-t" chapters="chapters/5.xml"

This does the whole book but is also much faster:

  make test="-t"

There are many possible sub-targets as well, such as:

  make test="-t" pdf_web

Also, -t there makes internal links break and strips out the
glossary; -s only does the former.

Here's a list of all the make targets you care about, as of May
2012:

  all (default)
  clean
  realclean
  xhtml_web
  xhtml
  xhtml_sections_web
  xhtml_sections
  xhtml_nochunks_web
  xhtml_nochunks
  epub
  epub_web
  mobi
  mobi_web
  pdf
  pdf_web

They all have _test versions as well.

Requirements
------------

Getting this all working is actually a pretty huge undertaking;
you're almost certainly better off asking Robin Lee Powell for an
account on the appropriate server.
