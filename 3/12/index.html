          <h3>12. Oddball Orthographies</h3>

    <p>The following notes describe ways in which Lojban has been
    written or could be written that differ from the standard
    orthography explained in the rest of this chapter. Nobody needs
    to read this section except people with an interest in the
    obscure. Technicalities are used without explanation or further
    apology.</p>

    <p>There exists an alternative orthography for Lojban, which is
    designed to be as compatible as possible (but no more so) with
    the authority used in pre-Lojban versions of Loglan. The
    consonants undergo no change, except that “x” is replaced by
    “h”. The individual vowels likewise remain unchanged.
    However, the vowel pairs and diphthongs are changed as
    follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>“ai”, “ei”, “oi”, “au” become “ai”, “ei”, “oi”, “ao”.</li>

      <li>“ia” through “iu” and “ua” through “uu” remain unchanged.</li>

      <li>“a'i”, “e'i”, “o'i” and “a'o” become “a,i”, “e,i”, “o,i” and “a,o”.</li>

      <li>“i'a” through “i'u” and “u'a” through “u'u” are
      changed to “ia” through “iu” and “ua” through “uu” in
      lujvo and cmavo other than attitudinals, but become “i,a”
      through “i,u” and “u,a” through “u,u” in names,
      fu'ivla, and attitudinal cmavo.</li>

      <li>All other vowel pairs simply drop the apostrophe.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The result of these rules is to eliminate the apostrophe
    altogether, replacing it with comma where necessary, and
    otherwise with nothing. In addition, names and the cmavo “.i”
    are capitalized, and irregular stress is marked with an
    apostrophe (now no longer used for a sound) following the
    stressed syllable.</p>

    <p>Three points must be emphasized about this alternative
    orthography:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>It is not standard, and has not been used.</li>

      <li>It does not represent any changes to the standard Lojban
      phonology; it is simply a representation of the same
      phonology using a different written form.</li>

      <li>It was designed to aid in a planned rapprochement between
      the Logical Language Group and The Loglan Institute, a group
      headed by James Cooke Brown. The rapprochement never took
      place.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There also exists a Cyrillic orthography for Lojban which was
    designed when the introductory Lojban brochure was translated
    into Russian. It uses the “а”, “б”, “в”, “г”, “д”, “е”, “ж”, “з”,
    “и”, “к”, “л”, “м”, “н”, “о”, “п”, “р”, “с”, “т”, “у”, “ф”,
    “х”, and “ш” in the obvious ways. The Latin
    letter “y” is mapped onto the hard sign “ъ”, as in Bulgarian. The
    apostrophe, comma, and period are unchanged. Diphthongs are
    written as vowel pairs, as in the Roman representation.</p>

    <p>Finally, an orthography using the Tengwar of F&eacute;anor,
    a fictional orthography invented by J. R. R. Tolkien and
    described in the Appendixes to <cite>The Lord Of The
    Rings</cite>, has been devised for Lojban. The following
    mapping, which closely resembles that used for Westron, will be
    meaningful only to those who have read those appendixes. In
    brief, the tincot&eacute;ma and parmat&eacute;ma are used in
    the conventional ways; the calmat&eacute;ma represents palatal
    consonants, and the quesset&eacute;ma represents velar
    consonants.

<pre>
    t   tinco       p   parma
    -   calma       k   quesse
    d   ando        b   umbar
    -   anga        g   ungwe
    -   thule       f   formen
    c   harma       x   hwesta
    -   anto        v   ampa
    j   anca        -   unque
    n   numen       m   malta
    -   noldo       -   nwalme
    r   ore         u   vala
    i   anna        -   vilya
</pre>

    The letters “vala” and “anna” are used for “u” and
    “i” only when those letters are used to represent glides. Of
    the additional letters, “r”, “l”, “s”, and “z” are
    written with “r&oacute;men”, “lambe”, “silme”, and
    “&aacute;re”/“esse” respectively; the inverted forms are used
    as free variants.</p>

    <p>Lojban, like Quenya, is a vowel-last language, so tehtar are
    read as following the tengwar on which they are placed. The
    conventional tehtar are used for the five regular vowels, and
    the under-dot for “y”. The Lojban apostrophe is represented
    by “halla”. There is no equivalent of the Lojban comma or
    period.</p>
