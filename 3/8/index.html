          <h3>8. Buffering Of Consonant Clusters</h3>

    <p>Many languages do not have consonant clusters at all, and
    even those languages that do have them often allow only a
    subset of the full Lojban set. As a result, the Lojban design
    allows the use of a buffer sound between consonant combinations
    which a speaker finds unpronounceable. This sound may be any
    non-Lojbanic vowel which is clearly separable by the listener
    from the Lojban vowels. Some possibilities are IPA <span
    class="c3">[ɪ]</span>, <span class="c3">[ɨ]</span>, <span
    class="c3">[ʊ]</span>, or even <span class="c3">[ʏ]</span>, but
    there probably is no universally acceptable buffer sound. When
    using a consonant buffer, the sound should be made as short as
    possible. Two examples showing such buffering (we will use
    <span class="c3">[ɪ]</span> in this chapter) are:

<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">8.1)</a>  vrusi
    <span class="c3">['vru si]</span>
    or <span class="c3">[vɪ 'ru si]</span>
</pre>

<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">8.2)</a>  .AMsterdam.
    <span class="c3">[ʔam ster damʔ]</span>
    or <span class="c3">['ʔa mɪ sɪ tɛ rɪ da mɪʔ]</span>
</pre>
</p>

    <p>When a buffer vowel is used, it splits each buffered consonant
    into its own syllable. However, the buffering syllables are
    never stressed, and are not counted in determining stress. They
    are, in effect, not really syllables to a Lojban listener, and
    thus their impact is ignored.</p>

    <p>Here are more examples of unbuffered and buffered
    pronunciations:

<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">8.3)</a>  klama
    <span class="c3">['kla ma]</span>
    <span class="c3">[kɪ la ma]</span>

<a id="4" name="4">8.4)</a>   xapcke
    <span class="c3">['xap ʃkɛ]</span>
    <span class="c3">['xa pɪ ʃkɛ]</span>
    <span class="c3">['xa pɪ ʃɪ kɛ]</span>
</pre>

    In <a href="../8/#4">Example 8.4</a>, we see that buffering
    vowels can be used in just some, rather than all, of the
    possible places: the second pronunciation buffers the “pc”
    consonant pair but not the “ck”. The third pronunciation
    buffers both.</p>

<p>
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">8.5)</a>  ponyni’u
    <span class="c3">[po nə 'ni hu]</span>
</pre>

    <a href="../8/#5">Example 8.5</a> cannot contain any buffering
    vowel. It is important not to confuse the vowel “y”, which is
    pronounced <span class="c3">[ə]</span>, with the buffer,
    which has a variety of possible pronunciations and is never
    written. Consider the contrast between 

<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">8.6)</a>  bongynanba
    <span class="c3">[boŋ gə 'nan ba]</span>
</pre>

    an unlikely Lojban compound word meaning “bone bread” (note
    the use of <span class="c3">[ŋ]</span> as a representative of
    “n” before “g”) and 

<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">8.7)</a>  bongnanba
    <span class="c3">[boŋ 'gnan ba]</span>
</pre>

    a possible borrowing from another language (Lojban borrowings
    can only take a limited form). If <a href="../8/#7">Example
    8.7</a> were pronounced with buffering, as 
<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">8.8)</a>  <span
class="c3">[boŋ gɪ 'nan ba]</span>
</pre>

    it would be very similar to <a href="../8/#6">Example 8.6</a>.
    Only a clear distinction between “y” and any buffering vowel
    would keep the two words distinct.</p>

    <p>Since buffering is done for the benefit of the speaker in
    order to aid pronounceability, there is no guarantee that the
    listener will not mistake a buffer vowel for one of the six
    regular Lojban vowels. The buffer vowel should be as laxly
    pronounced as possible, as central as possible, and as short as
    possible. Furthermore, it is worthwhile for speakers who use
    buffers to pronounce their regular vowels a bit longer than
    usual, to avoid confusion with buffer vowels. The speakers of
    many languages will have trouble correctly hearing any of the
    suggested buffer vowels otherwise. By this guideline, <a
    href="../8/#8">Example 8.8</a> would be pronounced

<pre>
<a id="9" name="9">8.9)</a>  <span class="c3">[boːŋ gɪ 'naːn baː]</span>
</pre>

    with lengthened vowels.</p>
