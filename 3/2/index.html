          <h3><a id="2" name="2">2. Basic Phonetics</h3>

    <p>Lojban pronunciations are defined using the International
    Phonetic Alphabet, or IPA, a standard method of transcribing
    pronunciations. By convention, IPA transcriptions are always
    within square brackets: for example, the word ``cat'' is
    pronounced (in General American pronunciation) <span
    class="c3">[kQt]</span>. <a href=../10/>Section 10</a> contains
    a brief explanation of the IPA characters used in this chapter,
    with their nearest analogues in English, and will be especially
    useful to those not familiar with the technical terms used in
    describing speech sounds.</p>

    <p>The standard pronunciations and permitted variants of the
    Lojban letters are listed in the table below. The descriptions
    have deliberately been made a bit ambiguous to cover variations
    in pronunciation by speakers of different native languages and
    dialects. In all cases except ``r'' the first IPA symbol shown
    represents the preferred pronunciation; for ``r'', all of the
    variations (and any other rhotic sound) are equally
    acceptable.</p>

    The Lojban sounds must be clearly pronounced so that they are
    not mistaken for each other. Voicing and placement of the
    tongue are the key factors in correct pronunciation, but other
    subtle differences will develop between consonants in a
    Lojban-speaking community. At this point these are the only
    mandatory rules on the range of sounds. 

    <p>Note in particular that Lojban vowels can be pronounced with
    either rounded or unrounded lips; typically ``o'' and ``u'' are
    rounded and the others are not, as in English, but this is not
    a requirement; some people round ``y'' as well. Lojban
    consonants can be aspirated or unaspirated. Palatalizing of
    consonants, as found in Russian and other languages, is not
    generally acceptable in pronunciation, though a following ``i''
    may cause it.</p>

    <p>The sounds represented by the letters ``c'', ``g'', ``j'',
    ``s'', and ``x'' require special attention for speakers of
    English, either because they are ambiguous in the orthography
    of English (``c'', ``g'', ``s''), or because they are
    strikingly different in Lojban (``c'', ``j'', ``x''). The
    English ``c'' represents three different sounds, <span
    class="c3">[k]</span> in ``cat'' and <span
    class="c3">[s]</span> in ``cent'', as well as the <span
    class="c3">[S]</span> of ``ocean''. Similarly, English ``g''
    can represent <span class="c3">[g]</span> as in ``go'', <span
    class="c3">[dZ]</span> as in ``gentle'', and <span
    class="c3">[Z]</span> as in ``garage'' (in some
    pronunciations). English ``s'' can be either <span
    class="c3">[s]</span> as in ``cats'', <span
    class="c3">[z]</span> as in ``cards'', <span
    class="c3">[S]</span> as in ``tension'', or <span
    class="c3">[Z]</span> as in ``measure''. The sound of Lojban
    ``x'' doesn't appear in most English dialects at all.</p>

    <p>There are two common English sounds that are found in Lojban
    but are not not Lojban consonants: the ``ch'' of ``church'' and
    the ``j'' of ``judge''. In Lojban, these are considered two
    consonant sounds spoken together without an intervening vowel
    sound, and so are represented in Lojban by the two separate
    consonants: ``tc'' (IPA <span class="c3">[tS]</span>) and
    ``dj'' (IPA <span class="c3">[dZ]</span>). In general, whether
    a complex sound is considered one sound or two depends on the
    language: Russian views ``ts'' as a single sound, whereas
    English, French, and Lojban consider it to be a consonant
    cluster.</p>
