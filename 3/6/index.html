          <h3>6. Consonant Clusters</h3>

    <p>A consonant sound is a relatively brief speech-sound that
    precedes or follows a vowel sound in a syllable; its presence
    either preceding or following does not add to the count of
    syllables, nor is a consonant required in either position for
    any syllable. Lojban has seventeen consonants: for the purposes
    of this section, the apostrophe is not counted as a
    consonant.</p>

    <p>An important distinction dividing Lojban consonants is that
    of voicing. The following table shows the unvoiced consonants
    and the corresponding voiced ones:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
   UNVOICED    VOICED

    p       b
    t       d
    k       g
    f       v
    c       j
    s       z
    x       -
</pre>

    <p>The consonant “x” has no voiced counterpart in Lojban. The
    remaining consonants, “l”, “m”, “n”, and “r”, are
    typically pronounced with voice, but can be pronounced
    unvoiced.</p>

    <p>Consonant sounds occur in languages as single consonants, or
    as doubled, or as clustered combinations. Single consonant
    sounds are isolated by word boundaries or by intervening vowel
    sounds from other consonant sounds. Doubled consonant sounds
    are either lengthened like <span class="c3">[s]</span> in
    English “hiss”, or repeated like <span class="c3">[k]</span>
    in English “backcourt”. Consonant clusters consist of two or
    more single or doubled consonant sounds in a group, each of
    which is different from its immediate neighbor. In Lojban,
    doubled consonants are excluded altogether, and clusters are
    limited to two or three members, except in Lojbanized
    names.</p>

    <p>Consonants can occur in three positions in words: initial
    (at the beginning), medial (in the middle), and final (at the
    end). In many languages, the sound of a consonant varies
    depending upon its position in the word. In Lojban, as much as
    possible, the sound of a consonant is unrelated to its
    position. In particular, the common American English trait of
    changing a “t” between vowels into a “d” or even a flap
    (IPA <span class="c3">[&uml;]</span>) is unacceptable in
    Lojban.</p>

    <p>Lojban imposes no restrictions on the appearance of single
    consonants in any valid consonant position; however, no
    consonant (including syllabic consonants) occurs final in a
    word except in Lojbanized names.</p>

    <p>Pairs of consonants can also appear freely, with the
    following restrictions:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>1)</dt>

      <dd>It is forbidden for both consonants to be the same, as
      this would violate the rule against double consonants.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>2)</dt>

      <dd>It is forbidden for one consonant to be voiced and the
      other unvoiced. The consonants “l”, “m”, “n”, and “r”
      are exempt from this restriction. As a result, “bf” is
      forbidden, and so is “sd”, but both “fl” and “vl”, and
      both “ls” and “lz”, are permitted.</dd>

      <dt>3)</dt>

      <dd>It is forbidden for both consonants to be drawn from the
      set “c”, “j”, “s”, “z”.</dd>

      <dt>4)</dt>

      <dd>The specific pairs “cx”, “kx”, “xc”, “xk”, and
      “mz” are forbidden.</dd>
    </dl>
    These rules apply to all kinds of words, even Lojbanized names.
    If a name would normally contain a forbidden consonant pair, a
    “y” can be inserted to break up the pair: 
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">6.1)</a>  djeimyz.
    <span class="c3">[dZEj m&laquo;z/]</span>
    James
</pre>

    <p>The regular English pronunciation of “James”, which is
    <span class="c3">[dZEjmz]</span>, would Lojbanize as
    “djeimz.”, which contains a forbidden consonant pair.</p>
