          <h3>3. The Special Lojban Characters</h3>

    <p>The apostrophe, period, and comma need special attention.
    They are all used as indicators of a division between
    syllables, but each has a different pronunciation, and each is
    used for different reasons:</p>

    <p>The apostrophe represents a phoneme similar to a short,
    breathy English “h”, (IPA <span class="c3">[h]</span>). The
    letter “h” is not used to represent this sound for two
    reasons: primarily in order to simplify explanations of the
    morphology, but also because the sound is very common, and the
    apostrophe is a visually lightweight representation of it. The
    apostrophe sound is a consonant in nature, but is not treated
    as either a consonant or a vowel for purposes of Lojban
    morphology (word-formation), which is explained in <a
    href="../../4/1/">Chapter 4</a>. In addition, the apostrophe
    visually parallels the comma and the period, which are also
    used (in different ways) to separate syllables.</p>

    <p>The apostrophe is included in Lojban only to enable a smooth
    separation between vowels, while joining the vowels within a
    single word. In fact, one way to think of the apostrophe is as
    representing a unvoiced vowel glide.</p>

    <p>As a permitted variant, any unvoiced fricative other than
    those already used in Lojban may be used to render the
    apostrophe: IPA <span class="c3">[T]</span> is one possibility.
    The convenience of the listener should be regarded as paramount
    in deciding to use a substitute for <span
    class="c3">[h]</span>.</p>

    <p>The period represents a mandatory pause, with no specified
    length; a glottal stop (IPA <span class="c3">[/]</span>) is
    considered a pause of shortest length. A pause (or glottal
    stop) may appear between any two words, and in certain cases --
    explained in detail in <a href="../../4/1/">Chapter 4</a> ---
    must occur. In particular, a word beginning with a vowel is
    always preceded by a pause, and a word ending in a consonant is
    always followed by a pause.</p>

    <p>Technically, the period is an optional reminder to the
    reader of a mandatory pause that is dictated by the rules of
    the language; because these rules are unambiguous, a missing
    period can be inferred from otherwise correct text. Periods are
    included only as an aid to the reader.</p>

    <p>A period also may be found apparently embedded in a word.
    When this occurs, such a written string is not one word but
    two, written together to indicate that the writer intends a
    unitary meaning for the compound. It is not really necessary to
    use a space between words if a period appears.</p>

    <p>The comma is used to indicate a syllable break within a
    word, generally one that is not obvious to the reader. Such a
    comma is written to separate syllables, but indicates that
    there must be no pause between them, in contrast to the period.
    Between two vowels, a comma indicates that some type of glide
    may be necessary to avoid a pause that would split the two
    syllables into separate words. It is always legal to use the
    apostrophe (IPA <span class="c3">[h]</span>) sound in
    pronouncing a comma. However, a comma cannot be pronounced as a
    pause or glottal stop between the two letters separated by the
    comma, because that pronunciation would split the word into two
    words.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, a comma is usually only used to clarify the
    presence of syllabic “l”, “m”, “n”, or “r” (discussed
    later). Commas are never required: no two Lojban words differ
    solely because of the presence or placement of a comma.</p>

    <p>Here is a somewhat artificial example of the difference in
    pronunciation between periods, commas and apostrophes. In the
    English song about Old MacDonald’s Farm, the vowel string which
    is pronounced “ee-i-ee-i-o” in English could be Lojbanized
    with periods as:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">3.1)</a>  .i.ai.i.ai.o
    <span class="c3">[/i /aj /i /aj /o]</span>
    Ee! Eye! Ee! Eye! Oh!
</pre>

    <p>However, this would sound clipped, staccato, and unmusical
    compared to the English. Furthermore, although <a
    href="../3/#1">Example 3.1</a> is a string of meaningful Lojban
    words, as a sentence it makes very little sense. (Note the use
    of periods embedded within the written word.)</p>

    <p>If commas were used instead of periods, we could represent
    the English string as a Lojbanized name, ending in a
    consonant:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">3.2)</a>  .i,ai,i,ai,on.
    <span class="c3">[/i jaj ji jaj jon/]</span>
</pre>

    <p>The commas represent new syllable breaks, but prohibit the
    use of pauses or glottal stop. The pronunciation shown is just
    one possibility, but closely parallels the intended English
    pronunciation.</p>

    <p>However, the use of commas in this way is risky to
    unambiguous interpretation, since the glides might be heard by
    some listeners as diphthongs, producing something like</p>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">3.3)</a>  .i,iai,ii,iai,ion.
</pre>
    which is technically a different Lojban name. Since the intent
    with Lojbanized names is to allow them to be pronounced more
    like their native counterparts, the comma is allowed to
    represent vowel glides or some non-Lojbanic sound. Such an
    exception affects only spelling accuracy and the ability of a
    reader to replicate the desired pronunciation exactly; it will
    not affect the recognition of word boundaries. 

    <p>Still, it is better if Lojbanized names are always distinct.
    Therefore, the apostrophe is preferred in regular Lojbanized
    names that are not attempting to simulate a non-Lojban
    pronunciation perfectly. (Perfection, in any event, is not
    really achievable, because some sounds simply lack reasonable
    Lojbanic counterparts.)</p>

    <p>If apostrophes were used instead of commas in <a
    href="../3/#2">Example 3.2</a>, it would appear as:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">3.4)</a>  .i’ai’i’ai’on.
    <span class="c3">[/i hai hi hai hon/]</span>
</pre>
    which preserves the rhythm and length, if not the exact sounds,
    of the original English.
