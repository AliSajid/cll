    <h3><a id="s13" name="s13">14. Table of abstractors</h3>

    <p>The following table gives each abstractor, an English gloss
    for it, a Lojban gismu which is connected with it (more or less
    remotely: the associations between abstractors and gismu are
    meant more as memory hooks than for any kind of inference), the
    rafsi associated with it, and (on the following line) its place
    structure.</p>
