          <h3><a id="s11" name="s11">12. Event-type abstractors and event contour tenses</h3>

    <p>This section is a logical continuation of <a
    href="#s3">Section 3</a>.</p>

    <p>There exists a relationship between the four types of events
    explained in <a href="s3.html">Section 3</a> and the event contour
    tense cmavo of selma'o ZAhO. The specific cmavo of NU and of
    ZAhO are mutually interdefining; the ZAhO contours were chosen
    to fit the needs of the NU event types and vice versa. Event
    contours are explained in full in <a href="../c10/s1.html">Chapter
    10</a>, and only summarized here.</p>

    <p>The purpose of ZAhO cmavo is to represent the natural
    portions of an event, such as the beginning, the middle, and
    the end. They fall into several groups:</p>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>The cmavo ``pu'o'', ``ca'o'', and ``ba'o'' represent
      spans of time: before an event begins, while it is going on,
      and after it is over, respectively.</dd>

      <dt></dt>

      <dd>The cmavo ``co'a'', ``de'a'', ``di'a'', and ``co'u''
      represent points of time: the start of an event, the
      temporary stopping of an event, the resumption of an event
      after a stop, and the end of an event, respectively. Not all
      events can have breaks in them, in which case ``de'a'' and
      ``di'a'' do not apply.</dd>

      <dt></dt>

      <dd>The cmavo ``mo'u'' and ``za'o'' correspond to ``co'u''
      and ``ba'o'' respectively, in the case of those events which
      have a natural ending point that may not be the same as the
      actual ending point: ``mo'u'' refers to the natural ending
      point, and ``za'o'' to the time between the natural ending
      point and the actual ending point (the ``excessive'' or
      ``superfective'' part of the event).</dd>

      <dt></dt>

      <dd>The cmavo ``co'i'' represents an entire event considered
      as a point-event or achievement.</dd>
    </dl>
    All these cmavo are applicable to events seen as processes and
    abstracted with ``pu'u''. Only processes have enough internal
    structure to make all these points and spans of time
    meaningful. 

    <p>For events seen as states and abstracted with ``za'i'', the
    meaningful event contours are the spans ``pu'o'', ``ca'o'', and
    ``ba'o''; the starting and ending points ``co'a'' and ``co'u'',
    and the achievement contour ``co'i''. States do not have
    natural endings distinct from their actual ending. (It is an
    open question whether states can be stopped and resumed.)</p>

    <p>For events seen as activities and abstracted with ``zu'o'',
    the meaningful event contours are the spans ``pu'o'', ``ca'o'',
    and ``ba'o'', and the achievement contour ``co'i''. Because
    activities are inherently cyclic and repetitive, the beginning
    and ending points are not well-defined: you do not know whether
    an activity has truly begun until it begins to repeat.</p>

    <p>For events seen as point-events and abstracted with
    ``mu'e'', the meaningful event contours are the spans ``pu'o''
    and ``ba'o'' but not ``ca'o'' (a point-event has no duration),
    and the achievement contour ``co'i''.</p>

    <p>Note that the parts of events are themselves events, and may
    be treated as such. The points in time may be seen as ``mu'e''
    point-events; the spans of time may constitute processes or
    activities. Therefore, Lojban allows us to express processes
    within processes, activities within states, and many other
    complicated abstract things.</p>
