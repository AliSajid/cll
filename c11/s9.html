    <h3><a id="s9" name="s9">9. Minor abstraction types</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   li'i    NU  experience abstractor
    si'o    NU  concept abstractor
    su'u    NU  general abstractor
</pre>
    There are three more abstractors in Lojban, all of them little
    used so far. The abstractor ``li'i'' expresses experience: 
<pre>
<a id="e9d1" name="e9d1">9.1)</a>  mi morji le li'i mi verba
    I remember the experience-of (my being-a-child)
</pre>
    The abstractor ``si'o'' expresses a mental image, a concept, an
    idea: 
<pre>
<a id="e9d2"
name="e9d2">9.2)</a>  mi nelci le si'o la lojban. cu mulno
    I enjoy the concept-of Lojban being-complete.
</pre>
    Finally, the abstractor ``su'u'' is a vague abstractor, whose
    meaning must be grasped from context: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e9d3" name="e9d3">9.3)</a>  ko zgana le su'u
        le ci smacu cu bajra
    you [imperative] observe the abstract-nature-of
        the three mice running
    See how the three mice run!
</pre>
    All three of these abstractors have an x2 place. An experience
    requires an experiencer, so the place structure of ``li'i'' is:
    

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>x1 is the experience of (the bridi) as experienced by
      x2</dd>
    </dl>
    Similarly, an idea requires a mind to hold it, so the place
    structure of ``si'o'' is: 

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>x1 is the idea/concept of (the bridi) in the mind of
      x2</dd>
    </dl>
    Finally, there needs to be some way of specifying just what
    sort of abstraction ``su'u'' is representing, so its place
    structure is: 

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>x1 is an abstract nature of (the bridi) of type x2</dd>
    </dl>
    The x2 place of ``su'u'' allows it to serve as a substitute for
    any of the other abstractors, or as a template for creating new
    ones. For example, 
<pre>
<a id="e9d4" name="e9d4">9.4)</a>  le nu mi klama
    the event-of my going
</pre>
    can be paraphrased as 
<pre>
<a id="e9d5" name="e9d5">9.5)</a>  le su'u mi klama kei be lo fasnu
    the abstract-nature-of (my going) of-type an event
</pre>
    and there is a book whose title might be rendered in Lojban as:
    

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e9d6" name="e9d6">9.6)</a>  le su'u la .iecuas. kuctra
        selcatra kei
        be lo sao'rdzifa'a
        ke nalmatma'e sutyterjvi
    the abstract-nature-of (Jesus is-an-intersect-shape
        type-of-killed-one)
        of-type a slope-low-direction
        type-of non-motor-vehicle speed-competition
    The Crucifixion of Jesus Considered As A
        Downhill Bicycle Race
</pre>

    <p>Note the importance of using ``kei'' after ``su'u'' when the
    x2 of ``su'u'' (or any other abstractor) is being specified;
    otherwise, the ``be lo'' ends up inside the abstraction
    bridi.</p>
