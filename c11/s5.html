    <h3><a id="s5" name="s5">5. Amount abstractions</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo is discussed in this section:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
   ni  NU  amount abstraction
</pre>

    <p>Amount abstractions are far more limited than event or
    property abstractions. They really make sense only if the
    selbri of the abstracted bridi is subject to measurement of
    some sort. Thus we can speak of:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e5d1" name="e5d1">5.1)</a>  le ni le pixra cu blanu [kei]
    the amount-of (the picture being-blue)
    the amount of blueness in the picture
</pre>
    because ``blueness'' could be measured with a colorimeter or a
    similar device. However, 
<pre>
<a id="e5d2" name="e5d2">5.2)</a>  le ni la djein. cu mamta [kei]
    the amount-of (Jane being-a-mother)
    the amount of Jane's mother-ness (?)
    the amount of mother-ness in Jane (?)
</pre>
    makes very little sense in either Lojban or English. We simply
    do not have any sort of measurement scale for being a mother. 

    <p>Semantically, a sumti with ``le ni'' is a number; however,
    it cannot be treated grammatically as a quantifier in Lojban
    unless prefixed by the mathematical cmavo ``mo'e'':</p>
<pre>
<a id="e5d3" name="e5d3">5.3)</a>  li pa vu'u mo'e
        le ni le pixra cu blanu [kei]
    the-number 1 minus the-operand
        the amount-of (the picture being-blue)
    1 - B, where B = blueness of the picture
</pre>

    <p>Mathematical Lojban is beyond the scope of this chapter, and
    is explained more fully in <a href="../c18/s1.html">Chapter
    18</a>.</p>

    <p>There are contexts where either property or amount
    abstractions make sense, and in such constructions, amount
    abstractions can make use of ``ce'u'' just like property
    abstractors. Thus,</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e5d4"
name="e5d4">5.4)</a>  le pixra cu cenba le ka ce'u blanu [kei]
    the picture varies in-the property-of (X is blue)
    The picture varies in being blue.
    The picture varies in blueness.
</pre>
    is not the same as 
<pre>
<a id="e5d5"
name="e5d5">5.5)</a>  le pixra cu cenba le ni ce'u blanu [kei]
    the picture varies in-the amount-of (X is blue)
    The picture varies in how blue it is.
    The picture varies in blueness.
</pre>
    <a href="#e5d4">Example 5.4</a> conveys that the blueness comes
    and goes, whereas <a href="#e5d5">Example 5.5</a> conveys that
    its quantity changes over time. 

    <p>Whenever we talk of measurement of an amount, there is some
    sort of scale, and so the place structure of ``ni'' abstraction
    selbri is:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>x1 is the amount of (the bridi) on scale x2</dd>
    </dl>
    Note: the best way to express the x2 places of abstract sumti
    is to use something like ``le ni ... kei be''. See <a
    href="#e9d5">Example 9.5</a> for the use of this construction.
