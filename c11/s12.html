    <h3><a id="s12" name="s12">13. Abstractor connection</h3>

    <p>An abstractor may be replaced by two or more abstractors
    joined by logical or non-logical connectives. Connectives are
    explained in detail in <a href="../c14/s1.html">Chapter 14</a>.
    The connection can be expanded to one between two bridi which
    differ only in abstraction marker. <a href="#e13d1">Example
    13.1</a> and <a href="#e13d2">Example 13.2</a> are equivalent
    in meaning:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e13d1"
name="e13d1">13.1)</a>    le ka la frank. ciska cu xlali
        .ije le ni la frank. ciska cu xlali
    The quality-of Frank's writing is bad,
        and the quantity of Frank's writing is bad.

<a id="e13d2"
name="e13d2">13.2)</a> le ka je ni la frank. ciska cu xlali
    The quality and quantity of Frank's writing is bad.
</pre>

    <p>This feature of Lojban has hardly ever been used, and nobody
    knows what uses it may eventually have.</p>
