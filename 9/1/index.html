<h2>Chapter 9<br />
      To Boston Via The Road Go I, With An Excursion Into The Land Of Modals</h2>

          <h3>1. Introductory</h3>

    <p>The basic type of Lojban sentence is the bridi: a claim by
    the speaker that certain objects are related in a certain way.
    The objects are expressed by Lojban grammatical forms called
    “sumti”; the relationship is expressed by the Lojban
    grammatical form called a “selbri”.</p>

    <p>The sumti are not randomly associated with the selbri, but
    according to a systematic pattern known as the “place
    structure” of the selbri. This chapter describes the various
    ways in which the place structure of Lojban bridi is expressed
    and by which it can be manipulated. The place structure of a
    selbri is a sequence of empty slots into which the sumti
    associated with that selbri are placed. The sumti are said to
    occupy the places of a selbri.</p>

    <p>For our present purposes, every selbri is assumed to have a
    well-known place structure. If the selbri is a brivla, the
    place structure can be looked up in a dictionary (or, if the
    brivla is a lujvo not in any dictionary, inferred from the
    principles of lujvo construction as explained in <a
    href="../../12/1/">Chapter 12</a>); if the selbri is a tanru,
    the place structure is the same as that of the final component
    in the tanru.</p>

    <p>The stock example of a place structure is that of the gismu

<pre>
      x1 comes/goes to destination x2 from origin x3 via route x4 employing means of transport x5.
</pre>

    The “x1 ... x5” indicates that “klama” is a five-place
    predicate, and show the natural order (as assigned by the
    language engineers) of those places: agent, destination,
    origin, route, means.</p>

    <p>The place structures of brivla are not absolutely stable
    aspects of the language. The work done so far has attempted to
    establish a basic place structure on which all users can, at
    first, agree. In the light of actual experience with the
    individual selbri of the language, there will inevitably be
    some degree of change to the brivla place structures.</p>
