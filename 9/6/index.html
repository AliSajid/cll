          <h3>6. Modal tags: BAI</h3>

    <p>There are certain selbri which seem particularly useful in
    constructing modal tags. In particular, “pilno” is one of
    them. The place structure of “pilno” is:

<pre>
      x1 uses tool x2
</pre>

    and almost any selbri which represents an action may need to
    specify a tool. Having to say “fi'o se pilno” frequently
    would make many Lojban sentences unnecessarily verbose and
    clunky, so an abbreviation is provided in the language design:
    the compound cmavo “sepi'o”.</p>

    <p>Here “se” is used before a cmavo, namely “pi'o”, rather
    than before a brivla. The meaning of this cmavo, which belongs
    to selma'o BAI, is exactly the same as that of “fi'o pilno
    fe'u”. Since what we want is a tag based on “se pilno”
    rather than “pilno” &mdash; the tool, not the tool user &mdash; the
    grammar allows a BAI cmavo to be converted using a SE cmavo. <a
    href="../5/#2">Example 5.2</a> may therefore be rewritten as:

<pre>
<a id="1"
name="1">6.1)</a>   mi viska do sepi'o le zunle kanla
       I see you with-tool: the left eye
       I see you using my left eye.
</pre>

    The compound cmavo “sepi'o” is much shorter than “fi'o se
    pilno [fe'u]” and can be thought of as a single word meaning
    “with-tool”. The modal tag “pi'o”, with no “se”,
    similarly means “with-tool-user”, probably a less useful
    concept. Nevertheless, the parallelism with the place structure
    of “pilno” makes the additional syllable worthwhile.</p>

    <p>Some BAI cmavo make sense with as well as without a SE
    cmavo; for example, “ka'a”, the BAI corresponding to the
    gismu “klama”, has five usable forms corresponding to the
    five places of “klama” respectively:

<pre>
       ka'a        with-goer
       seka'a      with-destination
       teka'a      with-origin
       veka'a      with-route
       xeka'a      with-means-of-transport
</pre>

    Any of these tags may be used to provide modal places for
    bridi, as in the following examples:

<pre>
<a id="2"
name="2">6.2)</a>   la .eivn. cu vecnu loi flira cinta ka'a mi
       Avon sells a-mass-of face paint with-goer me.
       I am a traveling cosmetics salesperson for Avon.
</pre>

    (<a href="../6/#2">Example 6.2</a> may seem a bit strained, but
    it illustrates the way in which an existing selbri, “vecnu”
    in this case, may have a place added to it which might
    otherwise seem utterly unrelated.)

<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">6.3)</a>   mi cadzu seka'a la bratfyd.
       I walk with-destination Bradford.
       I am walking to Bradford.

<a id="4" name="4">6.4)</a>   bloti teka'a la nu,IORK.
       [Observative:] is-a-boat with-origin New York
       A boat from New York!

<a id="5" name="5">6.5)</a>   do bajra veka'a lo djine
       You run with-route a circle.
       You are running in circles.

<a id="6" name="6">6.6)</a>   mi citka xeka'a le vinji
       I eat with-means-of-transport the airplane.
       I eat in the airplane.
</pre>

    There are sixty-odd cmavo of selma'o BAI, based on selected
    gismu that seemed useful in a variety of settings. The list is
    somewhat biased toward English, because many of the cmavo were
    selected on the basis of corresponding English prepositions and
    preposition compounds such as “with”, “without”, and “by
    means of”. The BAI cmavo, however, are far more precise than
    English prepositions, because their meanings are fixed by the
    place structures of the corresponding gismu.</p>

    <p>All BAI cmavo have the form CV’V or CVV. Most of them are
    CV’V, where the C is the first consonant of the corresponding
    gismu and the two Vs are the two vowels of the gismu. The table
    in <a href=../16/>Section 16</a> shows the exceptions.</p>

    <p>There is one additional BAI cmavo that is not derived from a
    gismu: “do'e”. This cmavo is used when an extra place is
    needed, but it seems useful to be vague about the semantic
    implications of the extra place:

<pre>
<a id="7"
name="7">6.7)</a>   lo nanmu be do'e le berti cu klama le tcadu
       Some man [related to] the north came to-the city.
       A man of the north came to the city.
</pre>

    Here “le berti” is provided as a modal place of the selbri
    “nanmu”, but its exact significance is vague, and is
    paralleled in the colloquial translation by the vague English
    preposition “of”. <a href="../6/#7">Example 6.7</a> also
    illustrates a modal place bound into a selbri with “be”. This
    construction is useful when the selbri of a description
    requires a modal place; this and other uses of “be” are more
    fully explained in <a href="../../5/1/">Chapter 5</a>.</p>
