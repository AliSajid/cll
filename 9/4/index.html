          <h3>4. Conversion: SE</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
     se      SE                  2nd place conversion
     te      SE                  3rd place conversion
     ve      SE                  4th place conversion
     xe      SE                  5th place conversion
</pre>
    So far we have seen ways to move sumti around within a bridi,
    but the actual place structure of the selbri has always
    remained untouched. The conversion cmavo of selma'o SE are
    incorporated within the selbri itself, and produce a new selbri
    (called a converted selbri) with a different place structure.
    In particular, after the application of any SE cmavo, the
    number and purposes of the places remain the same, but two of
    them have been exchanged, the x1 place and another. Which place
    has been exchanged with x1 depends on the cmavo chosen. Thus,
    for example, when “se” is used, the x1 place is swapped with
    the x2 place. 

    <p>Note that the cmavo of SE begin with consecutive consonants
    in alphabetical order. There is no “1st place conversion”
    cmavo, because exchanging the x1 place with itself is a
    pointless maneuver.</p>

    <p>Here are the place structures of “se klama”:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>x1 is the destination of x2’s going from x3 via x4 using
      x5</dd>
    </dl>
    and “te klama”: 

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>x1 is the origin and x2 the destination of x3 going via
      x4 using x5</dd>
    </dl>
    and “ve klama”: 

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>x1 is the route to x2 from x3 used by x4 going via
      x5</dd>
    </dl>
    and “xe klama”: 

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>x1 is the means in going to x2 from x3 via x4 employed by
      x5</dd>
    </dl>
    Note that the place structure numbers in each case continue to
    be listed in the usual order, x1 to x5. 

    <p>Consider the following pair of examples:</p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">4.1)</a>  la bastn. cu se klama mi
    Boston is-the-destination of-me.
    Boston is my destination.
    Boston is gone to by me.

<a id="2" name="2">4.2)</a>   fe la bastn. cu klama fa mi
    x2 = Boston go x1=I.
    To Boston go I.
</pre>
    <a href="../4/#1">Example 4.1</a> and <a href="../4/#2">Example
    4.2</a> mean the same thing, in the sense that there is a
    relationship of going with the speaker as the agent and Boston
    as the destination (and with unspecified origin, route, and
    means). Structurally, however, they are quite different. <a
    href="../4/#1">Example 4.1</a> has “la bastn.” in the x1 place
    and “mi” in the x2 place of the selbri “se klama”, and uses
    standard bridi order; <a href="../4/#2">Example 4.2</a> has
    “mi” in the x1 place and “la bastn.” in the x2 place of the
    selbri “klama”, and uses a non-standard order. 

    <p>The most important use of conversion is in the construction
    of descriptions. A description is a sumti which begins with a
    cmavo of selma'o LA or LE, called the descriptor, and contains
    (in the simplest case) a selbri. We have already seen the
    descriptions “le dargu” and “le karce”. To this we could
    add:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">4.3)</a>  le klama
    the go-er, the one who goes
</pre>
    In every case, the description is about something which fits
    into the x1 place of the selbri. In order to get a description
    of a destination (that is, something fitting the x2 place of
    “klama”), we must convert the selbri to “se klama”, whose
    x1 place is a destination. The result is 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">4.4)</a>  le se klama
    the destination gone to by someone
</pre>

    <p>Likewise, we can create three more converted
    descriptions:</p>
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">4.5)</a>  le te klama
    the origin of someone’s going

<a id="6" name="6">4.6)</a>   le ve klama
    the route of someone’s going

<a id="7" name="7">4.7)</a>   le xe klama
    the means by which someone goes
</pre>
    <a href="../4/#6">Example 4.6</a> does not mean “the route”
    plain and simple: that is “le pluta”, using a different
    selbri. It means a route that is used by someone for an act of
    “klama”; that is, a journey with origin and destination. A
    “road” on Mars, on which no one has traveled or is ever
    likely to, may be called “le pluta”, but it cannot be “le ve
    klama”, since there exists no one for whom it is “le ve klama
    be fo da” (the route taken in an actual journey by someone
    [da]). 

    <p>When converting selbri that are more complex than a single
    brivla, it is important to realize that the scope of a SE cmavo
    is only the following brivla (or equivalent unit). In order to
    convert an entire tanru, it is necessary to enclose the tanru
    in “ke ... ke'e” brackets:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">4.8)</a>  mi se ke blanu zdani [ke'e] ti
    I [2nd conversion] blue house this-thing
</pre>

    <p>The place structure of “blanu zdani” (blue house) is the
    same as that of “zdani”, by the rule given in <a
    href=../1/>Section 1</a>. The place structure of “zdani”
    is:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>x1 is a house/nest/lair/den for inhabitant x2</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>The place structure of “se ke blanu zdani [ke'e]” is
    therefore:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>x1 is the inhabitant of the blue house (etc.) x2</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Consequently, <a href="../4/#8">Example 4.8</a> means:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>I am the inhabitant of the blue house which is this
      thing.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Conversion applied to only part of a tanru has subtler
    effects which are explained in <a href="../../5/1/">Chapter
    5</a>.</p>

    <p>It is grammatical to convert a selbri more than once with
    SE; later (inner) conversions are applied before earlier
    (outer) ones. For example, the place structure of “se te
    klama” is achieved by exchanging the x1 and x2 place of “te
    klama”, producing:</p>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>x1 is the destination and x2 is the origin of x3 going
      via x4 using x5</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>On the other hand, “te se klama” has a place structure
    derived from swapping the x1 and x3 places of “se klama”:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>x1 is the origin of x2’s going to x3 via x4 using x5</dd>
    </dl>
    which is quite different. However, multiple conversions like
    this are never necessary. Arbitrary scrambling of places can be
    achieved more easily and far more intelligibly with FA tags,
    and only a single conversion is ever needed in a description. 

    <p>(Although no one has made any real use of it, it is perhaps
    worth noting that compound conversions of the form “setese”,
    where the first and third cmavo are the same, effectively swap
    the two given places while leaving the others, including x1,
    alone: “setese” (or equivalently “tesete”) swap the x2 and
    x3 places, whereas “texete” (or “xetexe”) swap the x3 and
    x5 places.)</p>
