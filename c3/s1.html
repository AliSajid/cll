    <h3><a id="s1" name="s1">1. Orthography</h3>

    <p>Lojban is designed so that any properly spoken Lojban
    utterance can be uniquely transcribed in writing, and any
    properly written Lojban can be spoken so as to be uniquely
    reproduced by another person. As a consequence, the standard
    Lojban orthography must assign to each distinct sound, or
    phoneme, a unique letter or symbol. Each letter or symbol has
    only one sound or, more accurately, a limited range of sounds
    that are permitted pronunciations for that phoneme. Some
    symbols indicate stress (speech emphasis) and pause, which are
    also essential to Lojban word recognition. In addition,
    everything that is represented in other languages by
    punctuation (when written) or by tone of voice (when spoken) is
    represented in Lojban by words. These two properties together
    are known technically as ``audio-visual isomorphism''.</p>

    <p>Lojban uses a variant of the Latin (Roman) alphabet,
    consisting of the following letters and symbols:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>' , . a b c d e f g i j k l m n o p r s t u v x y z</dd>
    </dl>
    omitting the letters ``h'', ``q'', and ``w''. 

    <p>The alphabetic order given above is that of the ASCII coded
    character set, widely used in computers. By making Lojban
    alphabetical order the same as ASCII, computerized sorting and
    searching of Lojban text is facilitated.</p>

    <p>Capital letters are used only to represent non-standard
    stress, which can appear only in the representation of
    Lojbanized names. Thus the English name ``Josephine'', as
    normally pronounced, is Lojbanized as ``DJOsefin.'', pronounced
    <span class="c3">[&Egrave;dZo sE fin/]</span>. (See <a
    href="s2.html">Section 2</a> for an explanation of the symbols
    within square brackets.) Technically, it is sufficient to
    capitalize the vowel letter, in this case ``O'', but it is
    easier on the reader to capitalize the whole syllable.</p>

    <p>Without the capitalization, the ordinary rules of Lojban
    stress would cause the ``se'' syllable to be stressed.
    Lojbanized names are meant to represent the pronunciation of
    names from other languages with as little distortion as may be;
    as such, they are exempt from many of the regular rules of
    Lojban phonology, as will appear in the rest of this
    chapter.</p>
