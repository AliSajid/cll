          <h3><a id="s7" name="s7">7. Initial Consonant Pairs</h3>

    <p>The set of consonant pairs that may appear at the beginning
    of a word (excluding Lojbanized names) is far more restricted
    than the fairly large group of permissible consonant pairs
    described in <a href="s6.html">Section 6</a>. Even so, it is more
    than English allows, although hopefully not more than
    English-speakers (and others) can learn to pronounce.</p>

    <p>There are just 48 such permissible initial consonant pairs,
    as follows:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>bl br cf ck cl cm cn cp cr ct dj dr dz fl fr gl gr jb jd
      jg jm jv kl kr ml mr pl pr sf sk sl sm sn sp sr st tc tr ts
      vl vr xl xr zb zd zg zm zv</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Lest this list seem almost random, a pairing of voiced and
    unvoiced equivalent vowels will show significant patterns which
    may help in learning:</p>
<pre>
   pl pr           fl fr
    bl br           vl vr

    cp cf   ct ck cm cn cl cr
    jb jv   jd jg jm
    sp sf   st sk sm sn sl sr
    zb zv   zd zg zm

    tc tr   ts      kl kr
    dj dr   dz      gl gr

    ml mr           xl xr
</pre>
    Note that if both consonants of an initial pair are voiced, the
    unvoiced equivalent is also permissible, and the voiced pair
    can be pronounced simply by voicing the unvoiced pair. (The
    converse is not true: ``cn'' is a permissible initial pair, but
    ``jn'' is not.) 

    <p>Consonant triples can occur medially in Lojban words. They
    are subject to the following rules:</p>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dt>1)</dt>

      <dd>The first two consonants must constitute a permissible
      consonant pair;</dd>

      <dt>2)</dt>

      <dd>The last two consonants must constitute a permissible
      initial consonant pair;</dd>

      <dt>3)</dt>

      <dd>The triples ``ndj'', ``ndz'', ``ntc'', and ``nts'' are
      forbidden.</dd>
    </dl>
    Lojbanized names can begin or end with any permissible
    consonant pair, not just the 48 initial consonant pairs listed
    above, and can have consonant triples in any location, as long
    as the pairs making up those triples are permissible. In
    addition, names can contain consonant clusters with more than
    three consonants, again requiring that each pair within the
    cluster is valid.
