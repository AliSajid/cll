          <h3>2. Incidental relative clauses</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
     noi     NOI                 incidental relative clause introducer
</pre>
    There are two basic kinds of relative clauses: restrictive
    relative clauses introduced by “poi”, and incidental
    (sometimes called simply “non-restrictive”) relative clauses
    introduced by “noi”. The difference between restrictive and
    incidental relative clauses is that restrictive clauses provide
    information that is essential to identifying the referent of
    the sumti to which they are attached, whereas incidental
    relative clauses provide additional information which is
    helpful to the listener but is not essential for identifying
    the referent of the sumti. All of the examples in <a
    href=../1/>Section 1</a> are restrictive relative clauses: the
    information in the relative clause is essential to
    identification. (The title of this chapter, though, uses an
    incidental relative clause.) 

    <p>Consider the following examples:</p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">2.1)</a>  le gerku poi blanu cu barda
    The dog which is-blue is-large.
    The dog which is blue is large.

<a id="2" name="2">2.2)</a>   le gerku noi blanu cu barda
    The dog incidentally-which is-blue is-large.
    The dog, which is blue, is large.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="../2/#1">Example 2.1</a>, the information conveyed
    by “poi blanu” is essential to identifying the dog in
    question: it restricts the possible referents from dogs in
    general to dogs that are blue. This is why “poi” relative
    clauses are called restrictive. In <a href="../2/#2">Example
    2.2</a>, on the other hand, the dog which is referred to has
    presumably already been identified clearly, and the relative
    clause “noi blanu” just provides additional information about
    it. (If in fact the dog hasn’t been identified clearly, then
    the relative clause does not help identify it further.)</p>

    <p>In English, the distinction between restrictive and
    incidental relative clauses is expressed in writing by
    surrounding incidental, but not restrictive, clauses with
    commas. These commas are functioning as parentheses, because
    incidental relative clauses are essentially parenthetical. This
    distinction in punctuation is represented in speech by a
    difference in tone of voice. In addition, English restrictive
    relative clauses can be introduced by “that” as well as
    “which” and “who”, whereas incidental relative clauses
    cannot begin with “that”. Lojban, however, always uses the
    cmavo “poi” and “noi” rather than punctuation or intonation
    to make the distinction.</p>

    <p>Here are more examples of incidental relative clauses:</p>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">2.3)</a>  mi noi jdice cu zvati
    I who-incidentally am-a-judge am-at [some-place].
    I, a judge, am present.
</pre>

    <p>In this example, “mi” is already sufficiently restricted,
    and the additional information that I am a judge is being
    provided solely for the listener’s edification.</p>
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">2.4)</a>  xu do viska le mi karce noi blabi
    [True?] You see my car incidentally-which is-white.
    Do you see my car, which is white?
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="../2/#4">Example 2.4</a>, the speaker is presumed
    to have only one car, and is providing incidental information
    that it is white. (Alternatively, he or she might have more
    than one car, since “le karce” can be plural, in which case
    the incidental information is that each of them is white.)
    Contrast <a href="../2/#5">Example 2.5</a> with a restrictive
    relative clause:</p>
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">2.5)</a>  xu do viska le mi karce poi blabi
    [True?] You see my car which is-white.
    Do you see my car that is white?
    Do you see my white car?
</pre>
    Here the speaker probably has several cars, and is restricting
    the referent of the sumti “le mi karce” (and thereby the
    listener’s attention) to the white one only. <a
    href="../2/#5">Example 2.5</a> means much the same as <a
    href="../2/#6">Example 2.6</a>, which does not use a relative
    clause: 
<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">2.6)</a>  xu do viska le mi blabi karce
    [True?] You see my white car.
    Do you see my car, the white one?
</pre>
    So a restrictive relative clause attached to a description can
    often mean the same as a description involving a tanru.
    However, “blabi karce”, like all tanru, is somewhat vague: in
    principle, it might refer to a car which carries white things,
    or even express some more complicated concept involving
    whiteness and car-ness; the restrictive relative clause of <a
    href="../2/#5">Example 2.5</a> can only refer to a car which is
    white, not to any more complex or extended concept.
