          <h3>3. Relative phrases</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<pre>
     pe      GOI                 restrictive association
     po      GOI                 restrictive possession
     po'e    GOI                 restrictive intrinsic possession
     po'u    GOI                 restrictive identification
     ne      GOI                 incidental association
     no'u    GOI                 incidental identification
     ge'u    GEhU                relative phrase terminator
</pre>
</p>

    <p>There are types of relative clauses (those which have a certain
    selbri) which are frequently wanted in Lojban, and can be
    expressed using a shortcut called a relative phrase. Relative
    phrases are introduced by cmavo of selma'o GOI, and consist of
    a GOI cmavo followed by a single sumti.</p>

    <p>Here is an example of “pe”, plus an equivalent sentence
    using a relative clause:

<pre>
<a id="Example1">3.1)</a>   le stizu pe mi cu blanu
       The chair associated-with me is-blue.
       My chair is blue.

<a id="Example2">3.2)</a>   le stizu poi ke'a srana mi cu blanu
       The chair such-that( IT is-associated-with me) is-blue.
</pre>

    In <a href="../3/#Example1">Example 3.1</a> and <a
    href="../3/#2">Example 3.2</a>, the link between the chair and
    the speaker is of the loosest kind.</p>

    <p>Here is an example of “po”:

<pre>
<a id="Example3">3.3)</a>   le stizu po mi cu xunre
       The chair specific-to me is red.

<a id="Example4">3.4)</a>   le stizu poi
            ke'a se steci srana mi cu xunre
       The chair such-that
            (IT is-specifically associated-with me) is-red.
</pre>

    <a href="../3/#Example3">Example 3.3</a> and <a href="../3/#4">Example
    3.4</a> contrast with <a href="../3/#Example1">Example 3.1</a> and <a
    href="../3/#2">Example 3.2</a>: the chair is more permanently
    connected with the speaker. A plausible (though not the only
    possible) contrast between <a href="../3/#Example1">Example 3.1</a> and
    <a href="../3/#Example3">Example 3.3</a> is that “pe mi” would be
    appropriate for a chair the speaker is currently sitting on
    (whether or not the speaker owned that chair), and “po mi”
    for a chair owned by the speaker (whether or not he or she was
    currently occupying it).</p>

    <p>As a result, the relationship expressed between two sumti by
    “po” is usually called “possession”, although it does not
    necessarily imply ownership, legal or otherwise. The central
    concept is that of specificity (“steci” in Lojban).</p>

    <p>Here is an example of “po'e”, as well as another example
    of “po”:

<pre>
<a id="Example5">3.5)</a>   le birka po'e mi cu spofu
       The arm intrinsically-possessed-by me is-broken

<a id="Example6">3.6)</a>   le birka poi
            jinzi ke se steci srana mi
            cu spofu
       The arm which
            is-intrinsically (specifically associated-with) me
            is-broken

<a id="Example7">3.7)</a>   le botpi po mi cu spofu
       The bottle specific-to me is-broken
</pre>

    <a href="../3/#Example5">Example 3.5</a> and <a href="../3/#6">Example
    3.6</a> on the one hand, and <a href="../3/#Example7">Example 3.7</a> on
    the other, illustrate the contrast between two types of
    possession called “intrinsic” and “extrinsic”, or sometimes
    “inalienable” and “alienable”, respectively. Something is
    intrinsically (or inalienably) possessed by someone if the
    possession is part of the possessor, and cannot be changed
    without changing the possessor. In the case of <a
    href="../3/#5">Example 3.5</a>, people are usually taken to
    intrinsically possess their arms: even if an arm is cut off, it
    remains the arm of that person. (If the arm is transplanted to
    another person, however, it becomes intrinsically possessed by
    the new user, though, so intrinsic possession is a matter of
    degree.)</p>

    <p>By contrast, the bottle of <a href="../3/#Example7">Example 3.7</a>
    can be given away, or thrown away, or lost, or stolen, so it is
    possessed extrinsically (alienably). The exact line between
    intrinsic and extrinsic possession is culturally dependent. The
    U.S. Declaration of Independence speaks of the “inalienable
    rights” of men, but just what those rights are, and even
    whether the concept makes sense at all, varies from culture to
    culture.</p>

    <p>Note that <a href="../3/#Example5">Example 3.5</a> can also be
    expressed without a relative clause:

<pre>
<a id="Example8">3.8)</a>   le birka be mi cu spofu
       The arm of-body me is broken
</pre>

    reflecting the fact that the gismu “birka” has an x2 place
    representing the body to which the arm belongs. Many, but not
    all, cases of intrinsic possession can be thus covered without
    using “po'e” by placing the possessor into the appropriate
    place of the description selbri.</p>

    <p>Here is an example of “po'u”:
<pre>
<a id="Example9">3.9)</a>   le gerku po'u le mi pendo cu cinba mi
       The dog which-is my friend kisses me.

<a id="Example10">3.10)</a>  le gerku poi du le mi pendo cu cinba mi
       The dog which = my friend kisses me.
</pre>

    The cmavo “po'u” does not represent possession at all, but
    rather identity. (Note that it means “poi du” and its form
    was chosen to suggest the relationship.)</p>

    <p>In <a href="../3/#Example9">Example 3.9</a>, the use of “po'u”
    tells us that “le gerku” and “le mi pendo” represent the
    same thing. Consider the contrast between <a
    href="../3/#9">Example 3.9</a> and:

<pre>
<a id="Example11">3.11)</a>  le mi pendo po'u le gerku cu cinba mi
       My friend which-is the dog kisses me.
</pre>

    The facts of the case are the same, but the listener’s
    knowledge about the situation may not be. In <a
    href="../3/#9">Example 3.9</a>, the listener is presumed not to
    understand which dog is meant by “le gerku”, so the speaker
    adds a relative phrase clarifying that it is the particular dog
    which is the speaker’s friend.</p>

    <p><a href="../3/#Example11">Example 3.11</a>, however, assumes that the
    listener does not know which of the speaker’s friends is
    referred to, and specifies that it is the friend that is the
    dog (which dog is taken to be obvious). Here is another example
    of the same contrast:

<pre>
<a id="Example12">3.12)</a>  le tcadu po'u la nu,iork
       The city of New York [not another city].

<a id="Example13">3.13)</a>  la nu,iork po'u le tcadu
       New York the city (not the state or some other New York)
</pre>

    The principle that the possessor and the possessed may change
    places applies to all the GOI cmavo, and allows for the
    possibility of odd effects: 

<pre>
<a id="Example14">3.14)</a>  le kabri pe le mi pendo cu cmalu
       The cup associated-with my friend is small.
       My friend’s cup is small

<a id="Example15">3.15)</a>  le mi pendo pe le kabri cu cmalu
       My friend associated-with the cup is small.
       My friend, the one with the cup, is small.
</pre>

    <a href="../3/#Example14">Example 3.14</a> is useful in a context which
    is about my friend, and states that his or her cup is small,
    whereas <a href="../3/#Example15">Example 3.15</a> is useful in a
    context that is primarily about a certain cup, and makes a
    claim about “my friend of the cup”, as opposed to some other
    friend of mine. Here the cup appears to “possess” the person!
    English can’t even express this relationship with a possessive
    &mdash; “the cup’s friend of mine” looks like nonsense &mdash; but
    Lojban has no trouble doing so.</p>

    <p>Finally, the cmavo “ne” and “no'u” stand to “pe” and
    “po'u”, respectively, as “noi” does to “poi” &mdash; they
    provide incidental information:
<pre>
<a id="Example16">3.16)</a>  le blabi gerku ne mi cu batci do
       The white dog, incidentally-associated-with me, bites you.
       The white dog, which is mine, bites you.
</pre>

    In <a href="../3/#Example16">Example 3.16</a>, the white dog is
    already fully identified (after all, presumably the listener
    know which dog bit him or her!). The fact that it is yours is
    merely incidental to the main bridi claim.</p>

    <p>Distinguishing between “po'u” and “no'u” can be a little
    tricky. Consider a room with several men in it, one of whom is
    named Jim. If you don’t know their names, I might say:

<pre>
<a id="Example17">3.17)</a>  le nanmu no'u la djim. cu terpemci
       The man, incidentally-who-is Jim, is-a-poet.
       The man, Jim, is a poet.
</pre>

    Here I am saying that one of the men is a poet, and
    incidentally telling you that he is Jim. But if you do know the
    names, then

<pre>
<a id="Example18">3.18)</a>  le nanmu po'u la djim. cu terpemci
       The man who-is Jim is-a-poet.
       The man, the one named Jim, is a poet.
</pre>

    is appropriate. Now I am using the fact that the man I am
    speaking of is Jim in order to pick out which man I mean.</p>

    <p>It is worth mentioning that English sometimes over-specifies
    possession from the Lojban point of view (and the point of view
    of many other languages, including ones closely related to
    English). The idiomatic English sentence

<pre>
<a id="Example19">3.19)</a>  The man put his hands in his pockets.
</pre>

    seems strange to a French- or German-speaking person: whose
    pockets would he put his hands into? and even odder, whose
    hands would he put into his pockets? In Lojban, the sentence 

<pre>
<a id="Example20">3.20)</a>  le nanmu cu punji le xanci le daski
       The man puts the hand at-locus-the pocket.
</pre>

    is very natural. Of course, if the man is in fact putting his
    hands into another’s pockets, or another’s hands into his
    pockets, the fact can be specified.</p>

    <p>Finally, the elidable terminator for GOI cmavo is “ge'u”
    of selma'o GEhU; it is almost never required. However, if a
    logical connective immediately follows a sumti modified by a
    relative phrase, then an explicit “ge'u” is needed to allow
    the connective to affect the relativized sumti rather than the
    sumti of the relative phrase. (What about the cmavo after which
    selma'o GOI is named? It is discussed in <a
    href="../../7/1/">Chapter 7</a>, as it is not semantically akin
    to the other kinds of relative phrases, although the syntax is
    the same.)</p>
