          <h3>5. Non-veridical relative clauses: “voi”</h3>
<pre>
   voi NOI non-veridical relative clause introducer
</pre>
    There is another member of selma'o NOI which serves to
    introduce a third kind of relative clause: “voi”. Relative
    clauses introduced by “voi” are restrictive, like those
    introduced by “poi”. However, there is a fundamental
    difference between “poi” and “voi” relative clauses. A
    “poi” relative clause is said to be veridical, in the same
    sense that a description using “lo” or “loi” is: it is
    essential to the interpretation that the bridi actually be
    true. For example: 
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">5.1)</a>  le gerku poi blabi cu klama
    The dog which is-white goes.
</pre>
    it must actually be true that the dog is white, or the sentence
    constitutes a miscommunication. If there is a white dog and a
    brown dog, and the speaker uses “le gerku poi blabi” to refer
    to the brown dog, then the listener will not understand
    correctly. However, 
<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">5.2)</a>  le gerku voi blabi cu klama
    the dog which-I-describe-as white goes
</pre>
    puts the listener on notice that the dog in question may not
    actually meet objective standards (whatever they are) for being
    white: only the speaker can say exactly what is meant by the
    term. In this way, “voi” is like “le”; the speaker's
    intention determines the meaning. 

    <p>As a result, the following two sentences</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">5.3)</a>  le nanmu cu ninmu
    That-which-I-describe-as a-man is-a-woman.
    The “guy” is actually a gal.

<a id="4" name="4">5.4)</a>   ti voi nanmu cu ninmu
    This-thing which-I-describe-as a-man is-a-woman.
</pre>
    mean essentially the same thing (except that <a
    href="../5/#5">Example 5.5</a> involves pointing thanks to the
    use of “ti”, whereas <a href="../5/#4">Example 5.4</a>
    doesn't), and neither one is self-contradictory: it is
    perfectly all right to describe something as a man (although
    perhaps confusing to the listener) even if it actually is a
    woman.
