    <h3><a id="s15" name="s15">15. Conclusion</h3>

    <p>This chapter is incomplete. There are many more aspects of
    logic that I neither fully understand nor feel competent to
    explain, neither in abstract nor in their Lojban realization.
    Lojban was designed to be a language that makes predicate logic
    speakable, and achieving that goal completely will need to wait
    for someone who understands both logic and Lojban better than I
    do. I can only hope to have pointed out the areas that are
    well-understood (and by implication, those that are not).</p>
