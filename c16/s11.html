          <h3><a id="s11" name="s11">11. Using ``naku'' outside a prenex</h3>

    <p>Let us consider the English sentence</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e11d1"
name="e11d1">11.1)</a>    Some children do not go to school.
</pre>

    <p>We cannot express this directly with ``na''; the apparently
    obvious translation</p>
<pre>
<a id="e11d2" name="e11d2">11.2)</a>    su'oda poi verba
        na klama su'ode poi ckule
    At-least-one X which-are child(ren)
        [false] go-to at-least-one Y which-are school(s).
</pre>
    which converts to the external negation: 
<pre>
<a id="e11d3" name="e11d3">11.3)</a>    naku zo'u su'oda poi verba
        cu klama su'ode poi ckule
    It is false that some which are children
        go-to some which are schools.
    All children don't go to some school
        (not just some children).
</pre>
    Lojban provides a negation form which more closely emulates
    natural language negation. This involves putting ``naku''
    before the selbri, instead of a ``na''. ``naku'' is clearly a
    contradictory negation, given its parallel with prenex bridi
    negation. Using ``naku'', <a href="#e11d1">Example 11.1</a> can
    be expressed as: 
<pre>
<a id="e11d4" name="e11d4">11.4)</a>    su'oda poi verba naku klama
        su'ode poi ckule
    Some which-are children don't go-to
        some which-are schools.
    Some children don't go to a school.
</pre>
    Although it is not technically a sumti, ``naku'' can be used in
    most of the places where a sumti may appear. We'll see what
    this means in a moment. 

    <p>When you use ``naku'' within a bridi, you are explicitly
    creating a negation boundary. As explained in <a
    href="#s9">Section 9</a>, when a prenex negation boundary
    expressed by ``naku'' moves past a quantifier, the quantifier
    has to be inverted. The same is true for ``naku'' in the bridi
    proper. We can move ``naku'' to any place in the sentence where
    a sumti can go, inverting any quantifiers that the negation
    boundary crosses. Thus, the following are equivalent to <a
    href="#e11d4">Example 11.4</a> (no good English translations
    exist):</p>
<pre>
<a id="e11d5"
name="e11d5">11.5)</a>    su'oda poi verba cu klama rode poi ckule naku
    For some children, for every school,
        they don't go to it.

<a id="e11d6"
name="e11d6">11.6)</a> su'oda poi verba cu klama naku su'ode poi ckule
    Some children don't go to (some) school(s).

<a id="e11d7"
name="e11d7">11.7)</a> naku roda poi verba cu klama su'ode poi ckule
    It is false that all children go to some school(s).
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e11d5">Example 11.5</a>, we moved the negation
    boundary rightward across the quantifier of ``de'', forcing us
    to invert it. In <a href="#e11d7">Example 11.7</a> we moved the
    negation boundary across the quantifier of ``da'', forcing us
    to invert it instead. <a href="#e11d6">Example 11.6</a> merely
    switched the selbri and the negation boundary, with no effect
    on the quantifiers.</p>

    <p>The same rules apply if you rearrange the sentence so that
    the quantifier crosses an otherwise fixed negation. You can't
    just convert the selbri of <a href="#e11d4">Example 11.4</a>
    and rearrange the sumti to produce</p>
<pre>
<a id="e11d8"
name="e11d8">11.8)</a>    su'ode poi ckule ku'o naku se klama roda poi verba
    Some schools aren't gone-to-by every child.
</pre>
    or rather, <a href="#e11d8">Example 11.8</a> means something
    completely different from <a href="#e11d4">Example 11.4</a>.
    Conversion with ``se'' under ``naku'' negation is not
    symmetric; not all sumti are treated identically, and some
    sumti are not invariant under conversion. These complications
    would make Lojban much harder to learn (just as their
    corresponding natural language constructs are difficult to
    learn). Thus, internal negation with ``naku'' is considered an
    advanced technique, used to achieve stylistic compatibility
    with natural languages. 

    <p>It isn't always easy to see which quantifiers have to be
    inverted in a sentence. <a href="#e11d4">Example 11.4</a> is
    identical in meaning to:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e11d9"
name="e11d9">11.9)</a>    su'o verba naku klama su'o ckule
    Some children don't go-to some school.
</pre>
    but in <a href="#e11d9">Example 11.9</a>, the bound variables
    ``da'' and ``de'' have been hidden. 

    <p>It is trivial to export an internal bridi negation expressed
    with ``na'' to the prenex, as we saw in <a href="s9.html">Section
    9</a>; you just move it to the left end of the prenex. In
    comparison, it is non-trivial to export a ``naku'' to the
    prenex because of the quantifiers. The rules for exporting
    ``naku'' require that you export all of the quantified
    variables (implicit or explicit) along with ``naku'', and you
    must export them from left to right, in the same order that
    they appear in the sentence. Thus <a href="#e11d4">Example
    11.4</a> goes into prenex form as:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e11d10" name="e11d10">11.10)</a>  su'oda poi verba ku'o naku
        su'ode poi ckule zo'u
            da klama de
    For some X which is a child, it is not the case that
        there is a Y which is a school such that:
            X goes to Y.
</pre>

    <p>We can now move the ``naku'' to the left end of the prenex,
    getting a contradictory negation that can be expressed with
    ``na'':</p>
<pre>
<a id="e11d11" name="e11d11">11.11)</a>  naku roda poi verba
        su'ode poi ckule zo'u
            da klama de
    It is not the case that for all X's which are children,
        there is a Y which is a school such that:
            X goes to Y.
</pre>
    from which we can restore the quantified variables to the
    sentence, giving: 
<pre>
<a id="e11d12"
name="e11d12">11.12)</a>  naku zo'u roda poi verba cu klama su'ode poi ckule
    It is not the case that all children go to some school.
</pre>
    or more briefly 
<pre>
<a id="e11d13"
name="e11d13">11.13)</a>  ro verba cu na klama su'o ckule
    All children [false] go-to some school(s).
</pre>
    As noted in <a href="s5.html">Section 5</a>, a sentence with two
    different quantified variables, such as <a
    href="#e11d13">Example 11.13</a>, cannot always be converted
    with ``se'' without first exporting the quantified variables.
    When the variables have been exported, the sentence proper can
    be converted, but the quantifier order in the prenex must
    remain unchanged: 
<pre>
<a id="e11d14" name="e11d14">11.14)</a>  roda poi verba
        su'ode poi ckule zo'u
            de na se klama da
    It is not the case that for all X's which are children,
        there is a Y which is a school such that:
            Y is gone to by X.
</pre>
    While you can't freely convert with ``se'' when you have two
    quantified variables in a sentence, you can still freely move
    sumti to either side of the selbri, as long as the order isn't
    changed. If you use ``na'' negation in such a sentence, nothing
    special need be done. If you use ``naku'' negation, then
    quantified variables that cross the negation boundary must be
    inverted. 

    <p>Clearly, if all of Lojban negation was built on ``naku''
    negation instead of ``na'' negation, logical manipulation in
    Lojban would be as difficult as in natural languages. In <a
    href="#s12">Section 12</a>, for example, we'll discuss
    DeMorgan's Law, which must be used whenever a sumti with a
    logical connection is moved across a negation boundary.</p>

    <p>Since ``naku'' has the grammar of a sumti, it can be placed
    almost anywhere a sumti can go, including ``be'' and ``bei''
    clauses; it isn't clear what these mean, and we recommend
    avoiding such constructs.</p>

    <p>You can put multiple ``naku''s in a sentence, each forming a
    separate negation boundary. Two adjacent ``naku''s in a bridi
    are a double negative and cancel out:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e11d16"
name="e11d16">11.16)</a>  mi naku naku le zarci cu klama
</pre>

    <p>Other expressions using two ``naku''s may or may not cancel
    out. If there is no quantified variable between them, then the
    ``naku''s cancel.</p>

    <p>Negation with internal ``naku'' is clumsy and non-intuitive
    for logical manipulations, but then, so are the natural
    language features it is emulating.</p>
