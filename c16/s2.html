          <h3><a id="s2" name="s2">2. Existential claims, prenexes, and variables</h3>

    <p>Let us consider, to begin with, a sentence that is not in
    the dialogue:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e2d1" name="e2d1">2.1)</a>  Something sees me.
</pre>

    <p>There are two plausible Lojban translations of <a
    href="#e2d1">Example 2.1</a>. The simpler one is:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e2d2" name="e2d2">2.2)</a>  [zo'e] viska mi
    Something-unspecified sees me.
</pre>
    The cmavo ``zo'e'' indicates that a sumti has been omitted
    (indeed, even ``zo'e'' itself can be omitted in this case, as
    explained in <a href="../c7/s1.html">Chapter 7</a>) and the
    listener must fill in the correct value from context. In other
    words, <a href="#e2d2">Example 2.2</a> means ```You-know-what'
    sees me.'' 

    <p>However, <a href="#e2d1">Example 2.1</a> is just as likely
    to assert simply that there is someone who sees me, in which
    case a correct translation is:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e2d3" name="e2d3">2.3)</a>  da zo'u da viska mi
    There-is-an-X such-that X sees me.
</pre>
    <a href="#e2d3">Example 2.3</a> does not presuppose that the
    listener knows who sees the speaker, but simply tells the
    listener that there is someone who sees the speaker. Statements
    of this kind are called ``existential claims''. (Formally, the
    one doing the seeing is not restricted to being a person; it
    could be an animal or --- in principle --- an inanimate object.
    We will see in <a href="#s4">Section 4</a> how to represent
    such restrictions.) 

    <p><a href="#e2d3">Example 2.3</a> has a two-part structure:
    there is the part ``da zo'u'', called the prenex, and the part
    ``da viska mi'', the main bridi. Almost any Lojban bridi can be
    preceded by a prenex, which syntactically is any number of
    sumti followed by the cmavo ``zo'u'' (of selma'o ZOhU). For the
    moment, the sumti will consist of one or more of the cmavo
    ``da'', ``de'', and ``di'' (of selma'o KOhA), glossed in the
    literal translations as ``X'', ``Y'', and ``Z'' respectively.
    By analogy to the terminology of symbolic logic, these cmavo
    are called ``variables''.</p>

    <p>Here is an example of a prenex with two variables:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e2d4" name="e2d4">2.4)</a>  da de zo'u da prami de
    There-is-an-X there-is-a-Y such that X loves Y.
    Somebody loves somebody.
</pre>
    In <a href="#e2d4">Example 2.4</a>, the literal interpretation
    of the two variables ``da'' and ``de'' as ``there-is-an-X'' and
    ``there-is-a-Y'' tells us that there are two things which stand
    in the relationship that one loves the other. It might be the
    case that the supposed two things are really just a single
    thing that loves itself; nothing in the Lojban version of <a
    href="#e2d4">Example 2.4</a> rules out that interpretation,
    which is why the colloquial translation does not say ``Somebody
    loves somebody else.'' The things referred to by different
    variables may be different or the same. (We use ``somebody''
    here rather than ``something'' for naturalness; lovers and
    beloveds are usually persons, though the Lojban does not say
    so.) 

    <p>It is perfectly all right for the variables to appear more
    than once in the main bridi:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e2d5" name="e2d5">2.5)</a>  da zo'u da prami da
    There-is-an-X such that X loves X
    Somebody loves himself/herself.
</pre>
    What <a href="#e2d5">Example 2.5</a> claims is fundamentally
    different from what <a href="#e2d4">Example 2.4</a> claims,
    because ``da prami da'' is not structurally the same as ``da
    prami de''. However, 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e2d6" name="e2d6">2.6)</a>  de zo'u de prami de
    There-is-a-Y such that Y loves Y
</pre>
    means exactly the same thing as <a href="#e2d5">Example
    2.5</a>; it does not matter which variable is used as long as
    they are used consistently. 

    <p>It is not necessary for a variable to be a sumti of the main
    bridi directly:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e2d7" name="e2d7">2.7)</a>  da zo'u le da gerku cu viska mi
    There-is-an-X such-that the of-X dog sees me
    Somebody's dog sees me
</pre>
    is perfectly correct even though the ``da'' is used only in a
    possessive construction. (Possessives are explained in <a
    href="../c8/s1.html">Chapter 8</a>.) 

    <p>It is very peculiar, however, even if technically
    grammatical, for the variable not to appear in the main bridi
    at all:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e2d8" name="e2d8">2.8)</a>  da zo'u la ralf. gerku
    There is something such that Ralph is a dog.
</pre>
    has a variable bound in a prenex whose relevance to the claim
    of the following bridi is completely unspecified.
