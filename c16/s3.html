    <h3><a id="s3" name="s3">3. Universal claims</h3>

    <p>What happens if we substitute ``everything'' for
    ``something'' in <a href="#e2d1">Example 2.1</a>? We get:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e3d1" name="e3d1">3.1)</a>  Everything sees me.
</pre>
    Of course, this example is false, because there are many things
    which do not see the speaker. It is not easy to find simple
    truthful examples of so-called universal claims (those which
    are about everything), so bear with us for a while. (Indeed,
    some Lojbanists tend to avoid universal claims even in other
    languages, since they are so rarely true in Lojban.) 

    <p>The Lojban translation of <a href="#e3d1">Example 3.1</a>
    is</p>
<pre>
<a id="e3d2" name="e3d2">3.2)</a>  ro da zo'u da viska mi
    For-every X : X sees me.
</pre>
    When the variable cmavo ``da'' is preceded by ``ro'', the
    combination means ``For every X'' rather than ``There is an
    X''. Superficially, these English formulations look totally
    unrelated: <a href="s6.html">Section 6</a> will bring them within a
    common viewpoint. For the moment, accept the use of ``ro da''
    for ``everything'' on faith. 

    <p>Here is a universal claim with two variables:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e3d3" name="e3d3">3.3)</a>  ro da ro de zo'u da prami de
    For-every X, for-every Y : X loves Y.
    Everything loves everything.
</pre>

    <p>Again, X and Y can represent the same thing, so <a
    href="#e3d3">Example 3.3</a> does not mean ``Everything loves
    everything else.'' Furthermore, because the claim is universal,
    it is about every thing, not merely every person, so we cannot
    use ``everyone'' or ``everybody'' in the translation.</p>

    <p>Note that ``ro'' appears before both ``da'' and ``de''. If
    ``ro'' is omitted before either variable, we get a mixed claim,
    partly existential like those of <a href="s2.html">Section 2</a>,
    partly universal.</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e3d4" name="e3d4">3.4)</a>  ro da de zo'u da viska de
    For-every X, there-is-a-Y : X sees Y.
    Everything sees something.
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="e3d5" name="e3d5">3.5)</a>  da ro de zo'u da viska de
    There-is-an-X such-that-for-every-Y : X sees Y.
    Something sees everything.
</pre>
    <a href="#e3d4">Examples 3.4</a> and <a href="#e3d5">3.5</a>
    mean completely different things. <a href="#e3d4">Example
    3.4</a> says that for everything, there is something which it
    sees, not necessarily the same thing seen for every seer. <a
    href="#e3d5">Example 3.5</a>, on the other hand, says that
    there is a particular thing which can see everything that there
    is (including itself). Both of these are fairly silly, but they
    are different kinds of silliness. 

    <p>There are various possible translations of universal claims
    in English: sometimes we use ``anybody/anything'' rather than
    ``everybody/everything''. Often it makes no difference which of
    these is used: when it does make a difference, it is a rather
    subtle one which is explained in <a href="s8.html">Section
    8</a>.</p>
