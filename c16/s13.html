    <h3><a id="s13" name="s13">13. selbri variables</h3>

    <p>In addition to the variables ``da'', ``de'', and ``di'' that
    we have seen so far, which function as sumti and belong to
    selma'o KOhA, there are three corresponding variables ``bu'a'',
    ``bu'e'', and ``bu'i'' which function as selbri and belong to
    selma'o GOhA. These new variables allow existential or
    universal claims which are about the relationships between
    objects rather than the objects themselves. We will start with
    the usual silly examples; the literal translation will
    represent ``bu'a'', ``bu'e'' and ``bu'i'' with F, G, and H
    respectively.</p>

<pre>
<a id="e13d1" name="e13d1">13.1)</a>    su'o bu'a zo'u
        la djim. bu'a la djan.
    For-at-least-one relationship-F :
        Jim stands-in-relationship-F to-John.
    There's some relationship between Jim and John.
</pre>
    The translations of <a href="#e13d1">Example 13.1</a> show how
    unidiomatic selbri variables are in English; Lojban sentences
    like <a href="#e13d1">Example 13.1</a> need to be totally
    reworded in English. Furthermore, when a selbri variable
    appears in the prenex, it is necessary to precede it with a
    quantifier such as ``su'o''; it is ungrammatical to just say
    ``bu'a zo'u''. This rule is necessary because only sumti can
    appear in the prenex, and ``su'o bu'a'' is technically a sumti
    --- in fact, an indefinite description like ``re nanmu'', since
    ``bu'a'' is grammatically equivalent to a brivla like
    ``nanmu''. However, indefinite descriptions involving the
    bu'a-series cannot be imported from the prenex. 

    <p>When the prenex is omitted, the preceding number has to be
    omitted too:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e13d2" name="e13d2">13.2)</a>    la djim. bu'a la djan.
    Jim stands-in-at-least-one-relationship to-John.
</pre>
    As a result, if the number before the variable is anything but
    ``su'o'', the prenex is required: 
<pre>
<a id="e13d3" name="e13d3">13.3)</a>    ro bu'a zo'u
        la djim. bu'a la djan.
    For-every relationship-F :
        Jim stands-in-relationship-F to-John.
    Every relationship exists between Jim and John.
</pre>
    <a href="#e13d1">Example 13.1</a> and <a href="#e13d2">Example
    13.2</a> are almost certainly true: Jim and John might be
    brothers, or might live in the same city, or at least have the
    property of being jointly human. <a href="#e13d3">Example
    13.3</a> is palpably false, however; if Jim and John were
    related by every possible relationship, then they would have to
    be both brothers and father-and-son, which is impossible.
