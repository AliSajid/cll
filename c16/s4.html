    <h3><a id="s4" name="s4">4. Restricted claims: ``da poi''</h3>

    <p>The universal claims of <a href="s3.html">Section 3</a> are not
    only false but absurd: there is really very little to be said
    that is both true and non-trivial about every object
    whatsoever. Furthermore, we have been glossing over the
    distinction between ``everything'' and ``everybody'' and the
    other pairs ending in ``-thing'' and ``-body''. It is time to
    bring up the most useful feature of Lojban variables: the
    ability to restrict their ranges.</p>

    <p>In Lojban, a variable ``da'', ``de'', or ``di'' may be
    followed by a ``poi'' relative clause in order to restrict the
    range of things that the variable describes. Relative clauses
    are described in detail in <a href="../c8/s1.html">Chapter 8</a>,
    but the kind we will need at present consist of ``poi''
    followed by a bridi (often just a selbri) terminated with
    ``ku'o'' or ``vau'' (which can usually be elided). Consider the
    difference between</p>
<pre>
<a id="e4d1" name="e4d1">4.1)</a>  da zo'u da viska la djim.
    There-is-an-X : X sees Jim.
    Something sees Jim.
</pre>
    and 
<pre>
<a id="e4d2"
name="e4d2">4.2)</a>  da poi prenu zo'u da viska la djim.
    There-is-an-X which is-a-person : X sees Jim.
    Someone sees Jim.
</pre>
    In <a href="#e4d1">Example 4.1</a>, the variable ``da'' can
    refer to any object whatever; there are no restrictions on it.
    In <a href="#e4d2">Example 4.2</a>, ``da'' is restricted by the
    ``poi prenu'' relative clause to persons only, and so ``da poi
    prenu'' translates as ``someone.'' (The difference between
    ``someone'' and ``somebody'' is a matter of English style, with
    no real counterpart in Lojban.) If <a href="#e4d2">Example
    4.2</a> is true, then <a href="#e4d1">Example 4.1</a> must be
    true, but not necessarily vice versa. 

    <p>Universal claims benefit even more from the existence of
    relative clauses. Consider</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e4d3" name="e4d3">4.3)</a>  ro da zo'u da vasxu
    For-every X : X breathes
    Everything breathes
</pre>
    and 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e4d4" name="e4d4">4.4)</a>  ro da poi gerku zo'u da vasxu
    For-every X which is-a-dog : X breathes.
    Every dog breathes.
    Each dog breathes.
    All dogs breathe.
</pre>
    <a href="#e4d3">Example 4.3</a> is a silly falsehood, but <a
    href="#e4d4">Example 4.4</a> is an important truth (at least if
    applied in a timeless or potential sense: see <a
    href="../c10/s1.html">Chapter 10</a>). Note the various colloquial
    translations ``every dog'', ``each dog'', and ``all dogs''.
    They all come to the same thing in Lojban, since what is true
    of every dog is true of all dogs. ``All dogs'' is treated as an
    English plural and the others as singular, but Lojban makes no
    distinction. 

    <p>If we make an existential claim about dogs rather than a
    universal one, we get:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e4d5" name="e4d5">4.5)</a>  da poi gerku zo'u da vasxu
    There-is-an-X which is-a-dog : X breathes.
    Some dog breathes.
