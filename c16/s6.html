    <h3><a id="s6" name="s6">6. Variables with generalized quantifiers</h3>

    <p>So far, we have seen variables with either nothing in front,
    or with the cmavo ``ro'' in front. Now ``ro'' is a Lojban
    number, and means ``all''; thus ``ro prenu'' means ``all
    persons'', just as ``re prenu'' means ``two persons''. In fact,
    unadorned ``da'' is also taken to have an implicit number in
    front of it, namely ``su'o'', which means ``at least one''. Why
    is this? Consider <a href="#e2d3">Example 2.3</a> again, this
    time with an explicit ``su'o'':</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e6d1" name="e6d1">6.1)</a>  su'o da zo'u da viska mi
    For-at-least-one X : X sees me.
    Something sees me.
</pre>

    <p>From this version of <a href="#e2d3">Example 2.3</a>, we
    understand the speaker's claim to be that of all the things
    that there are, at least one of them sees him or her. The
    corresponding universal claim, <a href="#e3d2">Example 3.2</a>,
    says that of all the things that exist, every one of them can
    see the speaker.</p>

    <p>Any other number can be used instead of ``ro'' or ``su'o''
    to precede a variable. Then we get claims like:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e6d2" name="e6d2">6.2)</a>  re da zo'u da viska mi
    For-two-Xes : X sees me.
    Two things see me.
</pre>
    This means that exactly two things, no more or less, saw the
    speaker on the relevant occasion. In English, we might take
    ``Two things see me'' to mean that at least two things see the
    speaker, but there might be more; in Lojban, though, that claim
    would have to be made as: 
<pre>
<a id="e6d3" name="e6d3">6.3)</a>  su'ore da zo'u da viska mi
    For-at-least-two Xes : X sees me.
</pre>
    which would be false if nothing, or only one thing, saw the
    speaker, but not otherwise. We note the ``su'o'' here meaning
    ``at least''; ``su'o'' by itself is short for ``su'opa'' where
    ``pa'' means ``one'', as is explained in <a
    href="../c18/s1.html">Chapter 18</a>. 

    <p>The prenex may be removed from <a href="#e6d2">Examples
    6.2</a> and <a href="#e6d3">6.3</a> as from the others, leading
    to:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e6d4" name="e6d4">6.4)</a>  re da viska mi
    Two Xes see me.
</pre>
    and 
<pre>
<a id="e6d5" name="e6d5">6.5)</a>  su'ore da viska mi
    At-least-two Xes see me.
</pre>
    respectively, subject to the rules prescribed in <a
    href="s5.html">Section 5</a>. 

    <p>Now we can explain the constructions ``ro prenu'' for ``all
    persons'' and ``re prenu'' for ``two persons'' which were
    casually mentioned at the beginning of this Section. In fact,
    ``ro prenu'', a so-called ``indefinite description'', is
    shorthand for ``ro DA poi prenu'', where ``DA'' represents a
    fictitious variable that hasn't been used yet and will not be
    used in future. (Even if all three of ``da'', ``de'', and
    ``di'' have been used up, it does not matter, for there are
    ways of getting more variables, discussed in <a
    href="s14.html">Section 14</a>.) So in fact</p>
<pre>
<a id="e6d6" name="e6d6">6.6)</a>  re prenu viska mi
    Two persons see me.
</pre>
    is short for 
<pre>
<a id="e6d7" name="e6d7">6.7)</a>  re da poi prenu cu viska mi
    Two Xes which are-persons see me.
</pre>
    which in turn is short for: 
<pre>
<a id="e6d8" name="e6d8">6.8)</a>  re da poi prenu zo'u da viska mi
    For-two Xes which are-persons : X sees me.
</pre>
    Note that when we move more than one variable to the prenex
    (along with its attached relative clause), we must make sure
    that the variables are in the same order in the prenex as in
    the bridi proper.
