          <h3><a id="s12" name="s12">12. Logical Connectives and DeMorgan's Law</h3>

    <p>DeMorgan's Law states that when a logical connective between
    terms falls within a negation, then expanding the negation
    requires a change in the connective. Thus (where ``p'' and
    ``q'' stand for terms or sentences) ``not (p or q)'' is
    identical to ``not p and not q'', and ``not (p and q)'' is
    identical to ``not p or not q''. The corresponding changes for
    the other two basic Lojban connectives are: ``not (p equivalent
    to q)'' is identical to ``not p exclusive-or not q'', and ``not
    (p whether-or-not q)'' is identical to both ``not p
    whether-or-not q'' and ``not p whether-or-not not q''. In any
    Lojban sentence having one of the basic connectives, you can
    substitute in either direction from these identities. (These
    basic connectives are explained in <a
    href="../c14/s1.html">Chapter 14</a>.)</p>

    <p>The effects of DeMorgan's Law on the logical connectives
    made by modifying the basic connectives with ``nai'', ``na''
    and ``se'' can be derived directly from these rules; modify the
    basic connective for DeMorgan's Law by substituting from the
    above identities, and then, apply each ``nai'', ``na'' and
    ``se'' modifier of the original connectives. Cancel any double
    negatives that result.</p>

    <p>When do we apply DeMorgan's Law? Whenever we wish to
    ``distribute'' a negation over a logical connective; and, for
    internal ``naku'' negation, whenever a logical connective moves
    in to, or out of, the scope of a negation --- when it crosses a
    negation boundary.</p>

    <p>Let us apply DeMorgan's Law to some sample sentences. These
    sentences make use of forethought logical connectives, which
    are explained in <a href="../c14/s1.html">Chapter 14</a>. It
    suffices to know that ``ga'' and ``gi'', used before each of a
    pair of sumti or bridi, mean ``either'' and ``or''
    respectively, and that ``ge'' and ``gi'' used similarly mean
    ``both'' and ``and''. Furthermore, ``ga'', ``ge'', and ``gi''
    can all be suffixed with ``nai'' to negate the bridi or sumti
    that follows.</p>

    <p>We have defined ``na'' and ``naku zo'u'' as, respectively,
    internal and external bridi negation. These forms being
    identical, the negation boundary always remains at the left end
    of the prenex. Thus, exporting or importing negation between
    external and internal bridi negation forms never requires
    DeMorgan's Law to be applied. <a href="#e12d1">Example 12.1</a>
    and <a href="#e12d2">Example 12.2</a> are exactly
    equivalent:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e12d1"
name="e12d1">12.1)</a>    la djan. na klama ga la paris. gi la rom.
    John [false] goes-to either Paris or Rome.

<a id="e12d2"
name="e12d2">12.2)</a> naku zo'u la djan. klama ga la paris. gi la rom.
    It-is-false that: John goes-to either Paris or Rome.
</pre>
    It is not an acceptable logical manipulation to move a negator
    from the bridi level to one or more sumti. However, <a
    href="#e12d1">Example 12.1</a> and related examples are not
    sumti negations, but rather expand to form two logically
    connected sentences. In such a situation, DeMorgan's Law must
    be applied. For instance, <a href="#e12d2">Example 12.2</a>
    expands to: 
<pre>
<a id="e12d3"
name="e12d3">12.3)</a>    ge la djan. la paris. na klama
        gi la djan. la rom. na klama
    [It is true that] both John, to-Paris, [false] goes,
        and John, to-Rome, [false] goes.
</pre>

    <p>The ``ga'' and ``gi'', meaning ``either-or'', have become
    ``ge'' and ``gi'', meaning ``both-and'', as a consequence of
    moving the negators into the individual bridi.</p>

    <p>Here is another example of DeMorgan's Law in action,
    involving bridi-tail logical connection (explained in <a
    href="../c14/s1.html">Chapter 14</a>):</p>
<pre>
<a id="e12d4"
name="e12d4">12.4)</a>    la djein. le zarci na ge dzukla gi bajrykla
    Jane to-the market [false] both walks and runs.

<a id="e12d5"
name="e12d5">12.5)</a> la djein. le zarci ganai dzukla ginai bajrykla
    Jane to-the market either [false] walks or [false] runs.
    Jane to-the market if walks then ([false] runs).
</pre>
    (Placing ``le zarci'' before the selbri makes sure that it is
    properly associated with both parts of the logical connection.
    Otherwise, it is easy to erroneously leave it off one of the
    two sentences.) 

    <p>It is wise, before freely doing transformations such as the
    one from <a href="#e12d4">Example 12.4</a> to <a
    href="#e12d5">Example 12.5</a>, that you become familiar with
    expanding logical connectives to separate sentences,
    transforming the sentences, and then recondensing. Thus, you
    would prove the transformation correct by the following steps.
    By moving its ``na'' to the beginning of the prenex as a
    ``naku'', <a href="#e12d4">Example 12.4</a> becomes:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e12d6"
name="e12d6">12.6)</a>    naku zo'u la djein. le zarci
        ge dzukla gi bajrykla
    It is false that : Jane to-the market
        (both walks and runs).
</pre>

    <p>And by dividing the bridi with logically connected selbri
    into two bridi,</p>
<pre>
<a id="e12d7"
name="e12d7">12.7)</a>    naku zo'u ge la djein. le zarci dzukla
        gi la djein. le zarci bajrykla
    It-is-false-that: both (Jane to-the market walks)
        and (Jane to-the market runs).
</pre>
    is the result. 

    <p>At this expanded level, we apply DeMorgan's Law to
    distribute the negation in the prenex across both sentences, to
    get</p>
<pre>
<a id="e12d8"
name="e12d8">12.8)</a>    ga la djein. le zarci na dzukla
        gi la djein. le zarci na bajrykla
    Either Jane to-the market [false] walks,
        or Jane to-the market [false] runs.
</pre>
    which is the same as 
<pre>
<a id="e12d9"
name="e12d9">12.9)</a>    ganai la djein. le zarci dzukla
        ginai la djein. le zarci bajrykla
    If Jane to-the market walks,
        then Jane to-the market [false] runs.
    If Jane walks to the market, then she doesn't run.
</pre>
    which then condenses down to <a href="#e12d5">Example 12.5</a>.
    

    <p>DeMorgan's Law must also be applied to internal ``naku''
    negations:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e12d10"
name="e12d10">12.10)</a>  ga la paris. gi la rom. naku se klama la djan.
    (Either Paris or Rome) is-not gone-to-by John.

<a id="e12d11"
name="e12d11">12.11)</a>   la djan. naku klama ge la paris. gi la rom.
    John doesn't go-to both Paris and Rome.
</pre>

    <p>That <a href="#e12d10">Example 12.10</a> and <a
    href="#e12d11">Example 12.11</a> mean the same should become
    evident by studying the English. It is a good exercise to work
    through the Lojban and prove that they are the same.</p>
