          <h3><a id="s12" name="s12">12. Modal conversion: JAI</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   jai JAI modal conversion
    fai FA  modal place structure tag
</pre>
    So far, conversion of numbered bridi places with SE and the
    addition of modal places with BAI have been two entirely
    separate operations. However, it is possible to convert a
    selbri in such a way that, rather than exchanging two numbered
    places, a modal place is made into a numbered place. For
    example, 
<pre>
<a id="e12d1" name="e12d1">12.1)</a>    mi cusku bau la lojban.
    I express [something] in-language Lojban.
</pre>
    has an explicit x1 place occupied by ``mi'' and an explicit
    ``bau'' place occupied by ``la lojban.'' To exchange these two,
    we use a modal conversion operator consisting of ``jai'' (of
    selma'o JAI) followed by the modal cmavo. Thus, the modal
    conversion of <a href="#e12d1">Example 12.1</a> is: 
<pre>
<a id="e12d2"
name="e12d2">12.2)</a>    la lojban. jai bau cusku fai mi
    Lojban is-the-language-of-expression used-by me.
</pre>
    In <a href="#e12d2">Example 12.2</a>, the modal place ``la
    lojban.'' has become the x1 place of the new selbri ``jai bau
    cusku''. What has happened to the old x1 place? There is no
    numbered place for it to move to, so it moves to a special
    ``unnumbered place'' marked by the tag ``fai'' of selma'o FA. 

    <p>Note: For the purposes of place numbering, ``fai'' behaves
    like ``fi'a''; it does not affect the numbering of the other
    places around it.</p>

    <p>Like SE conversions, JAI conversions are especially
    convenient in descriptions. We may refer to ``the language of
    an expression'' as ``le jai bau cusku'', for example.</p>

    <p>In addition, it is grammatical to use ``jai'' without a
    following modal. This usage is not related to modals, but is
    explained here for completeness. The effect of ``jai'' by
    itself is to send the x1 place, which should be an abstraction,
    into the ``fai'' position, and to raise one of the sumti from
    the abstract sub-bridi into the x1 place of the main bridi.
    This feature is discussed in more detail in <a
    href="../c11/s1.html">Chapter 11</a>. The following two examples
    mean the same thing:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e12d3" name="e12d3">12.3)</a>    le nu mi lebna le cukta
        cu se krinu le nu mi viska le cukta
    The event-of I take the book
        is-justified-by the event-of I see the book.
    My taking the book is justified by my seeing it.

<a id="e12d4"
name="e12d4">12.4)</a> mi jai se krinu le nu mi viska le cukta kei
        [fai le nu mi lebna le cukta]
    I am-justified by the event-of I see the book
        [namely, the event-of I take the book]
    I am justified in taking the book by seeing the book.
</pre>
    <a href="#e12d4">Example 12.4</a>, with the bracketed part
    omitted, allows us to say that ``I am justified'' whereas in
    fact it is my action that is justified. This construction is
    vague, but useful in representing natural-language methods of
    expression. 

    <p>Note: The uses of modals discussed in this section are
    applicable both to BAI modals and to ``fi'o''-plus-selbri
    modals.</p>
