          <h3><a id="s6" name="s6">6. Modal tags: BAI</h3>

    <p>There are certain selbri which seem particularly useful in
    constructing modal tags. In particular, ``pilno'' is one of
    them. The place structure of ``pilno'' is:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>x1 uses tool x2</dd>
    </dl>
    and almost any selbri which represents an action may need to
    specify a tool. Having to say ``fi'o se pilno'' frequently
    would make many Lojban sentences unnecessarily verbose and
    clunky, so an abbreviation is provided in the language design:
    the compound cmavo ``sepi'o''. 

    <p>Here ``se'' is used before a cmavo, namely ``pi'o'', rather
    than before a brivla. The meaning of this cmavo, which belongs
    to selma'o BAI, is exactly the same as that of ``fi'o pilno
    fe'u''. Since what we want is a tag based on ``se pilno''
    rather than ``pilno'' --- the tool, not the tool user --- the
    grammar allows a BAI cmavo to be converted using a SE cmavo. <a
    href="#e5d2">Example 5.2</a> may therefore be rewritten as:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e6d1"
name="e6d1">6.1)</a>  mi viska do sepi'o le zunle kanla
    I see you with-tool: the left eye
    I see you using my left eye.
</pre>

    <p>The compound cmavo ``sepi'o'' is much shorter than ``fi'o se
    pilno [fe'u]'' and can be thought of as a single word meaning
    ``with-tool''. The modal tag ``pi'o'', with no ``se'',
    similarly means ``with-tool-user'', probably a less useful
    concept. Nevertheless, the parallelism with the place structure
    of ``pilno'' makes the additional syllable worthwhile.</p>

    <p>Some BAI cmavo make sense with as well as without a SE
    cmavo; for example, ``ka'a'', the BAI corresponding to the
    gismu ``klama'', has five usable forms corresponding to the
    five places of ``klama'' respectively:</p>
<pre>
   ka'a        with-goer
    seka'a      with-destination
    teka'a      with-origin
    veka'a      with-route
    xeka'a      with-means-of-transport
</pre>

    <p>Any of these tags may be used to provide modal places for
    bridi, as in the following examples:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e6d2"
name="e6d2">6.2)</a>  la .eivn. cu vecnu loi flira cinta ka'a mi
    Avon sells a-mass-of face paint with-goer me.
    I am a traveling cosmetics salesperson for Avon.
</pre>
    (<a href="#e6d2">Example 6.2</a> may seem a bit strained, but
    it illustrates the way in which an existing selbri, ``vecnu''
    in this case, may have a place added to it which might
    otherwise seem utterly unrelated.) 
<pre>
<a id="e6d3" name="e6d3">6.3)</a>  mi cadzu seka'a la bratfyd.
    I walk with-destination Bradford.
    I am walking to Bradford.

<a id="e6d4" name="e6d4">6.4)</a>   bloti teka'a la nu,IORK.
    [Observative:] is-a-boat with-origin New York
    A boat from New York!

<a id="e6d5" name="e6d5">6.5)</a>   do bajra veka'a lo djine
    You run with-route a circle.
    You are running in circles.

<a id="e6d6" name="e6d6">6.6)</a>   mi citka xeka'a le vinji
    I eat with-means-of-transport the airplane.
    I eat in the airplane.
</pre>
    There are sixty-odd cmavo of selma'o BAI, based on selected
    gismu that seemed useful in a variety of settings. The list is
    somewhat biased toward English, because many of the cmavo were
    selected on the basis of corresponding English prepositions and
    preposition compounds such as ``with'', ``without'', and ``by
    means of''. The BAI cmavo, however, are far more precise than
    English prepositions, because their meanings are fixed by the
    place structures of the corresponding gismu. 

    <p>All BAI cmavo have the form CV'V or CVV. Most of them are
    CV'V, where the C is the first consonant of the corresponding
    gismu and the two Vs are the two vowels of the gismu. The table
    in <a href="#s16">Section 16</a> shows the exceptions.</p>

    <p>There is one additional BAI cmavo that is not derived from a
    gismu: ``do'e''. This cmavo is used when an extra place is
    needed, but it seems useful to be vague about the semantic
    implications of the extra place:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e6d7"
name="e6d7">6.7)</a>  lo nanmu be do'e le berti cu klama le tcadu
    Some man [related to] the north came to-the city.
    A man of the north came to the city.
</pre>
    Here ``le berti'' is provided as a modal place of the selbri
    ``nanmu'', but its exact significance is vague, and is
    paralleled in the colloquial translation by the vague English
    preposition ``of''. <a href="#e6d7">Example 6.7</a> also
    illustrates a modal place bound into a selbri with ``be''. This
    construction is useful when the selbri of a description
    requires a modal place; this and other uses of ``be'' are more
    fully explained in <a href="../c5/s1.html">Chapter 5</a>.
