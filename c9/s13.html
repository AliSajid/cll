    <h3><a id="s13" name="s13">13. Modal negation</h3>

    <p>Negation is explained in detail in <a
    href="../c15/s1.html">Chapter 15</a>. There are two forms of
    negation in Lojban: contradictory and scalar negation.
    Contradictory negation expresses what is false, whereas scalar
    negation says that some alternative to what has been stated is
    true. A simple example is the difference between ``John didn't
    go to Paris'' (contradictory negation) and ``John went to
    (somewhere) other than Paris'' (scalar negation).</p>

    <p>Contradictory negation involving BAI cmavo is performed by
    appending ``-nai'' (of selma'o NAI) to the BAI. A common use of
    modals with ``-nai'' is to deny a causal relationship:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e13d1"
name="e13d1">13.1)</a>    mi nelci do mu'inai le nu do nelci mi
    I like you, but not because you like me.
</pre>
    <a href="#e13d1">Example 13.1</a> denies that the relationship
    between my liking you (which is asserted) and your liking me
    (which is not asserted) is one of motivation. Nothing is said
    about whether you like me or not, merely that that hypothetical
    liking is not the motivation for my liking you. 

    <p>Scalar negation is achieved by prefixing ``na'e'' (of
    selma'o NAhE), or any of the other cmavo of NAhE, to the BAI
    cmavo.</p>

<pre>
<a id="e13d2"
name="e13d2">13.2)</a>    le spati cu banro na'emu'i le nu
        do djacu dunda fi le spati
    The plant grows other-than-motivated-by the event-of
        you water-give to the plant.
</pre>
    <a href="#e13d2">Example 13.2</a> says that the relationship
    between the plant's growth and your watering it is not one of
    motivation: the plant is not motivated to grow, as plants are
    not something which can have motivation as a rule. Implicitly,
    some other relationship between watering and growth exists, but
    <a href="#e13d2">Example 13.2</a> doesn't say what it is
    (presumably ``ri'a''). 

    <p>Note: Modals made with ``fi'o'' plus a selbri cannot be
    negated directly. The selbri can itself be negated either with
    contradictory or with scalar negation, however.</p>
