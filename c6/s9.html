          <h3><a id="s9" name="s9">9. sumti-based descriptions</h3>

    <p>As stated in <a href="s2.html">Section 2</a>, most descriptions
    consist of just a descriptor and a selbri. (In this chapter,
    the selbri have always been single gismu, but of course any
    selbri, however complex, can be employed in a description. The
    syntax and semantics of selbri are explained in <a
    href="../c5/s1.html">Chapter 5</a>.) In the intervening sections,
    inner and outer quantifiers have been added to the syntax. Now
    it is time to discuss a description of a radically different
    kind: the sumti-based description.</p>

    <p>A sumti-based description has a sumti where the selbri would
    normally be, and the inner quantifier is required --- it cannot
    be implicit. An outer quantifier is permitted but not
    required.</p>

    <p>A full theory of sumti-based descriptions has yet to be
    worked out. One common case, however, is well understood.
    Compare the following:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e9d1" name="e9d1">9.1)</a>  re do cu nanmu
    Two-of you are-men.
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="e9d2" name="e9d2">9.2)</a>  le re do cu nanmu
    The two-of you are men.
</pre>
    <a href="#e9d1">Example 9.1</a> simply specifies that of the
    group of listeners, size unknown, two are men. <a
    href="#e9d2">Example 9.2</a>, which has the sumti-based
    description ``le re do'', says that of the two listeners, all
    (the implicit outer quantifier ``ro'') are men. So in effect
    the inner quantifier ``re'' gives the number of individuals
    which the inner sumti ``do'' refers to. 

    <p>Here is another group of examples:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e9d3" name="e9d3">9.3)</a>  re le ci cribe cu bunre
    Two-of the three bears are-brown.

<a id="e9d4" name="e9d4">9.4)</a>   le re le ci cribe cu bunre
    The two-of the three bears are-brown.

<a id="e9d5" name="e9d5">9.5)</a>   pa le re le ci cribe cu bunre
    One-of the two-of the three bears are-brown.
</pre>
    In each case, ``le ci cribe'' restricts the bears (or alleged
    bears) being talked of to some group of three which the speaker
    has in mind. <a href="#e9d3">Example 9.3</a> says that two of
    them (which two is not stated) are brown. <a
    href="#e9d4">Example 9.4</a> says that a specific pair of them
    are brown. <a href="#e9d5">Example 9.5</a> says that of a
    specific pair chosen from the original three, one or the other
    of that pair is brown.
