    <h3><a id="s15" name="s15">15. More about non-logical connectives</h3>

    <p>The final three JOI cmavo, ``jo'e'', ``ku'a'', and ``pi'u'',
    are probably only useful when talking explicitly about sets.
    They represent three standard set operators usually called
    ``union'', ``intersection'', and ``cross product'' (also known
    as ``Cartesian product''). The union of two sets is a set
    containing all the members that are in either set; the
    intersection of two sets is a set containing all the members
    that are in both sets. The cross product of two sets is the set
    of all possible ordered pairs, where each ordered pair contains
    a single element from the first set followed by a single
    element from the second. This may seem very abstract;
    hopefully, the following examples will help:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e15d1"
name="e15d1">15.1)</a>    lo'i ricfu ku jo'e lo'i dotco
        cu barda
    The-set-of rich-things union the-set-of German-things
        is large.
    
<a id="e15d2" name="e15d2">15.2)</a> lo'i ricfu ku ku'a
        lo'i dotco cu cmalu
    The set-of rich-things intersection
        the-set-of German-things is small.
</pre>
    There is a parallelism between logic and set theory that makes
    <a href="#e15d1">Example 15.1</a> and <a href="#e15d2">Example
    15.2</a> equivalent respectively to: 
<pre>
<a id="e15d3"
name="e15d3">15.3)</a>    lo'i ricfu ja dotco cu barda
    The-set-of rich-or-German-things is large.
</pre>
    and 
<pre>
<a id="e15d4"
name="e15d4">15.4)</a>    lo'i ricfu je dotco cu cmalu
    The-set-of rich-and-German-things is small.
</pre>

    <p>The following example uses ``se remei'', which is a set (not
    a mass) of two elements:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e15d5"
name="e15d5">15.5)</a>    la djeimyz. ce[bo] la djordj.
        pi'u la meris. cebo la martas.
        cu prami se remei
    James and-set George
        cross-product Mary and-set Martha
        are-lover type-of-pairs.
</pre>
    means that each of the pairs James/Mary, George/Mary,
    James/Martha, and George/Martha love each other. Therefore it
    is similar in meaning to <a href="#e14d13">Example 14.13</a>;
    however, that example speaks only of the men loving the women,
    not vice versa. 

    <p>Joiks may be combined with ``bo'' or with ``ke'' in the same
    way as eks and jeks; this allows grouping of non-logical
    connections between sumti and tanru units, in complete
    parallelism with logical connections:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e15d6"
name="e15d6">15.6)</a>    mi joibo do ce la djan. joibo la djein.
        cu gunma se remei
    (I massed-with you) and (John massed-with Jane)
        are-a-mass type-of-two-set
</pre>
    asserts that there is a set of two items each of which is a
    mass. 

    <p>Non-logical connection is permitted at the joint of a
    termset; this is useful for associating more than one sumti or
    tagged sumti with each side of the non-logical connection. The
    place structure of ``casnu'' is:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>the mass x1 discusses/talks about x2</dd>
    </dl>
    so the x1 place must be occupied by a mass (for reasons not
    explained here); however, different components of the mass may
    discuss in different languages. To associate each participant
    with his or her language, we can say: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e15d7" name="e15d7">15.7)</a>     mi ce'e bau la lojban.
        pe'e joi do ce'e bau la gliban. nu'u casnu
    ( I [plus] in-language Lojban
        massed-with you [plus] in-language English ) discuss.
</pre>

    <p>Like all non-logical connectives, the usage shown in <a
    href="#e15d7">Example 15.7</a> cannot be mechanically converted
    into a non-logical connective placed at another location in the
    bridi. The forethought equivalent of <a href="#e15d7">Example
    15.7</a> is:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e15d8"
name="e15d8">15.8)</a>     nu'i joigi mi bau la lojban
        gi do bau la gliban. nu'u casnu
</pre>
    Non-logical forethought termsets are also useful when the
    things to be non-logically connected are sumti preceded with
    tense or modal (BAI) tags: 
<pre>
<a id="e15d9"
name="e15d9">15.9)</a>    la djan. fa'u la frank. cusku
        nu'i bau la lojban.
        nu'u fa'u
            bai la djordj. [nu'u]
    John respectively-with Frank express
        [start termset] in-language Lojban
        [joint] respectively-with
            under-compulsion-by George.
    John and Frank speak in Lojban and under George's
        compulsion, respectively.
</pre>
    <a href="#e14d17">Example 14.17</a> associates speaking in
    Lojban with John, and speaking under George's compulsion with
    Frank. We do not know what language Frank uses, or whether John
    speaks under anyone's compulsion. 

    <p>Joiks may be prefixed with ``.i'' to produce ijoiks, which
    serve to non-logically connect sentences. The main known use
    here is ``.ice'o'', which indicates that the event of the
    second bridi follows that of the first bridi in some way other
    than a time relationship (which is handled with a tense):</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e15d10" name="e15d10">15.10)</a>  mi ba gasnu la'edi'e
        .i tu'e kanji lo ni cteki
        .ice'o lumci le karce
        .ice'o dzukansa le gerku tu'u
    I [future] do the-referent-of-the-following:
        ( Compute the quantity of taxes.
        And-then wash the car.
        And-then walkingly-accompany the dog. )
    List of things to do:
        Figure taxes.
        Wash car.
        Walk dog.
</pre>
    <a href="#e15d10">Example 15.10</a> represents a list of things
    to be done in priority order. The order is important, hence the
    need for a sequence connective, but does not necessarily
    represent a time order (the dog may end up getting walked
    first). Note the use of ``tu'e'' and ``tu'u'' as general
    brackets around the whole list. This is related to, but
    distinct from, their use in <a href="s8.html">Section 8</a>,
    because there is no logical connective between the introductory
    phrase ``mi ba gasnu la'edi'e'' and the rest. The brackets
    effectively show how large an utterance the word ``di'e'',
    which means ``the following utterance'', refers to. 

    <p>The following ``nai'', if present, does not negate either of
    the things to be connected, but instead specifies that some
    other connection (logical or non-logical) is applicable: it is
    a scalar negation:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e15d11" name="e15d11">15.11)</a>  mi jo'unai do cu remei
    I in-common-with [not!] you are-a-twosome
</pre>

    <p>The result of ``mi jo'u do'' would be two individuals, not a
    mass, therefore ``jo'u'' is not applicable; ``joi'' would be
    the correct connective.</p>

    <p>There is no joik question cmavo as such; however, joiks and
    ijoiks may be uttered in isolation in response to a logical
    connective question, as in the following exchange:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e15d12" name="e15d12">15.12)</a>  do djica tu'a
        loi ckafi
        ji loi tcati
    You desire something-about
        a-mass-of coffee [what connective?]
        a-mass-of tea?
    Do you want coffee or tea?

<a id="e15d13" name="e15d13">15.13)</a>   joi
    Mixed-mass-and.
    Both as a mass (i.e, mixed together).
</pre>
    Ugh. (Or in Lojban: .a'unaisairo'o.)
