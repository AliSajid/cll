    <h3><a id="s7" name="s7">7. More than two propositions</h3>

    <p>So far we have seen logical connectives used to connect
    exactly two sentences. How about connecting three or more? Is
    this possible in Lojban? The answer is yes, subject to some
    warnings and some restrictions.</p>

    <p>Of the four primitive truth functions <span
    class="c3">A</span>, <span class="c3">E</span>, <span
    class="c3">O</span>, and <span class="c3">U</span>, all but
    <span class="c3">O</span> have the same truth values no matter
    how their component sentences are associated in pairs.
    Therefore,</p>
<pre>
<a id="e7d1"
name="e7d1">7.1)</a>  mi dotco .ije mi ricfu .ije mi nanmu
    I am-German.  And I am-rich.  And I am-a-man.
</pre>
    means that all three component sentences are true. Likewise, 
<pre>
<a id="e7d2"
name="e7d2">7.2)</a>  mi dotco .ija mi ricfu .ija mi nanmu
    I am-German.  Or I am-rich.  Or I am-a-man.
</pre>
    means that one or more of the component sentences is true. 

    <p><span class="c3">O</span>, however, is different. Working
    out the truth table for</p>
<pre>
<a id="e7d3" name="e7d3">7.3)</a>  mi dotco .ijo mi ricfu
        .ijo mi nanmu
    I am-German.  If-and-only-if I am-rich.
        If-and-only-if I am-a-man.
</pre>
    shows that <a href="#e7d3">Example 7.3</a> does not mean that
    either I am all three of these things or none of them; instead,
    an accurate translation would be: 

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>Of the three properties --- German-ness, wealth, and
      manhood -- I possess either exactly one or else all
      three.</dd>
    </dl>
    Because of the counterintuitiveness of this outcome, it is
    safest to avoid <span class="c3">O</span> with more than two
    sentences. Likewise, the connectives which involve negation
    also have unexpected truth values when used with more than two
    sentences. 

    <p>In fact, no combination of logical connectives can produce
    the ``all or none'' interpretation intended (but not achieved)
    by <a href="#e7d3">Example 7.3</a> without repeating one of the
    bridi. See <a href="#e8d11">Example 8.11</a>.</p>

    <p>There is an additional difficulty with the use of more than
    two sentences. What is the meaning of:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e7d4"
name="e7d4">7.4)</a>  mi nelci la djan. .ije mi nelci la martas.
        .ija mi nelci la meris.
    I like John.  And I like Martha.
        Or I like Mary.
</pre>

    <p>Does this mean:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e7d5" name="e7d5">7.5)</a>  I like John, and I like
        either Martha or Mary or both.
</pre>

    <p>Or is the correct translation:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e7d6"
name="e7d6">7.6)</a>  Either I like John and I like Martha,
        or I like Mary, or both.
</pre>
    <a href="#e7d6">Example 7.6</a> is the correct translation of
    <a href="#e7d4">Example 7.4</a>. The reason is that Lojban
    logical connectives pair off from the left, like many
    constructs in the language. This rule, called the left-grouping
    rule, is easy to forget, especially when intuition pulls the
    other way. Forethought connectives are not subject to this
    problem: 
<pre>
<a id="e7d7"
name="e7d7">7.7)</a>  ga ge mi nelci la djan. gi mi nelci la martas.
        gi mi nelci la meris.
    Either (Both I like John and I like Martha)
        or I like Mary.
</pre>
    is equivalent in meaning to <a href="#e7d4">Example 7.4</a>,
    whereas 
<pre>
<a id="e7d8" name="e7d8">7.8)</a>  ge mi nelci la djan. gi
        ga mi nelci la martas. gi mi nelci la meris.
    Both I like John and
        (Either I like Martha or I like Mary).
</pre>
    is not equivalent to <a href="#e7d4">Example 7.4</a>, but is
    instead a valid translation into Lojban, using forethought, of
    <a href="#e7d5">Example 7.5</a>.
