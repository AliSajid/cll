    <h3><a id="s6" name="s6">6. sumti connection</h3>

    <p>Geks and ijeks are sufficient to state every possible
    logical connection between two bridi. However, it is often the
    case that two bridi to be logically connected have one or more
    portions in common:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e6d1" name="e6d1">6.1)</a>  la djan. klama le zarci
        .ije la .alis. klama le zarci
    John goes to the market,
        and Alice goes to the market.
</pre>

    <p>Here only a single sumti differs between the two bridi.
    Lojban does not require that both bridi be expressed in full.
    Instead, a single bridi can be given which contains both of the
    different sumti and uses a logical connective from a different
    selma'o to combine the two sumti:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e6d2"
name="e6d2">6.2)</a>  la djan .e la .alis. klama le zarci
    John and Alice go-to the market.
</pre>
    <a href="#e6d2">Example 6.2</a> means exactly the same thing as
    <a href="#e6d1">Example 6.1</a>: one may be rigorously
    transformed into the other without any change of logical
    meaning. This rule is true in general for every different kind
    of logical connection in Lojban; all of them, with one
    exception (see <a href="s12.html">Section 12</a>), can always be
    transformed into a logical connection between sentences that
    expresses the same truth function. 

    <p>The afterthought logical connectives between sumti are eks,
    which contain a connective cmavo of selma'o A. If ijeks were
    used in <a href="#e6d2">Example 6.2</a>, the meaning would be
    changed:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e6d3"
name="e6d3">6.3)</a>  la djan. .ije la .alis. klama le zarci
    John [is/does something].  And Alices goes-to the market.
</pre>
    leaving the reader uncertain why John is mentioned at all. 

    <p>Any ek may be used between sumti, even if there is no direct
    English equivalent:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e6d4"
name="e6d4">6.4)</a>  la djan. .o la .alis. klama le zarci
    John if-and-only-if Alice goes-to the market.
    John goes to the market if, and only if, Alice does.
</pre>

    <p>The second line of <a href="#e6d3">Example 6.3</a> is highly
    stilted English, but the first line (of which it is a literal
    translation) is excellent Lojban.</p>

    <p>What about forethought sumti connection? As is the case for
    bridi connection, geks are appropriate. They are not the only
    selma'o of forethought logical-connectives, but are the most
    commonly used ones.</p>
<pre>
<a id="e6d5"
name="e6d5">6.5)</a>  ga la djan. gi la .alis. klama le zarci
    Either John or Alice (or both) goes-to the market.
</pre>
    Of course, eks include all the same patterns of compound cmavo
    that ijeks do. When ``na'' or ``se'' is part of an ek, a
    special writing convention is invoked, as in the following
    example: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e6d6"
name="e6d6">6.6)</a>  la djan. na.a la .alis. klama le zarci
    John only if Alice goes-to the market.
    John goes to the market only if Alice does.
</pre>

    <p>Note the period in ``na.a''. The cmavo of A begin with
    vowels, and therefore must always be preceded by a pause. It is
    conventional to write all connective compounds as single words
    (with no spaces), but this pause must still be marked in
    writing as in speech; otherwise, the ``na'' and ``a'' would
    tend to run together.</p>
