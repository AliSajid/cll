    <h3><a id="s19" name="s19">19. Abstractor connection and connection within
    abstractions</h3>

    <p>Last and (as a matter of fact) least: a logical connective
    is allowed between abstraction markers of selma'o NU. As usual,
    the connection can be expanded to a bridi connection between
    two bridi which differ only in abstraction marker. Jeks are the
    appropriate connective. <a href="#e19d1">Example 19.1</a> and
    <a href="#e19d2">Example 19.2</a> are equivalent in
    meaning:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e19d1"
name="e19d1">19.1)</a>    le ka la frank. ciska cu xlali
        .ije le ni la frank. ciska cu xlali
    The quality-of Frank's writing is bad,
        and the quantity of Frank's writing is bad.

<a id="e19d2"
name="e19d2">19.2)</a> le ka je ni la frank. ciska cu xlali
    The quality and quantity of Frank's writing is bad.
</pre>
    As with tenses and modals, there is no forethought and no way
    to override the left-grouping rule. 

    <p>Logical connectives and abstraction are related in another
    way as well, though. Since an abstraction contains a bridi, the
    bridi may have a logical connection inside it. Is it legitimate
    to split the outer bridi into two, joined by the logical
    connection? Absolutely not. For example:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e19d3"
name="e19d3">19.3)</a>    mi jinvi le du'u loi jmive cu zvati
        gi'onai na zvati vau la .iupiter.
    I opine the fact-that a-mass-of living-things (is-at
        or-else isn't-at) Jupiter.
    I believe there either is or isn't life on Jupiter.
</pre>
    is true, since the embedded sentence is a tautology, but: 
<pre>
<a id="e19d4" name="e19d4">19.4)</a>    mi jinvi le du'u loi jmive
        cu zvati la .iupiter.
    .ijonai mi jinvi le du'u loi jmive
        cu zvati la .iupiter.
    I opine the fact-that a-mass-of living-things
        is-at Jupiter
    or-else I opine the fact-that a-mass-of living-things
        isn't-at Jupiter
</pre>
    is false, since I have no evidence one way or the other
    (``jinvi'' requires some sort of evidence, real or fancied,
    unlike ``krici'').
