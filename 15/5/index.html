          <h3><a id="5" name="5">5. Expressing scales in selbri negation</h3>

    <p>In expressing a scalar negation, we must provide some
    indication of the scale, range, frame-of-reference, or universe
    of discourse that is being dealt with in an assertion. As
    stated in <a href=../4/>Section 4</a>, the default is the set
    of plausible alternatives. Thus if we say:</p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">5.1)</a>  le stizu cu na'e xunre
    The chair is a non-(red-thing).
</pre>
    the pragmatic interpretation is that we mean a different color
    and not 
<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">5.2)</a>  le stizu cu dzukla be le zarci
    The chair walkingly-goes-to-the-market.
</pre>

    <p>However, if we have reason to be more explicit (an obtuse or
    contrary listener, or simply an overt logical analysis), we can
    clarify that we are referring to a color by saying:</p>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">5.3)</a>  le stizu cu na'e xunre skari
    The chair is of a non-(red)-color
        (as perceived by something under some conditions).
</pre>

    <p>We might also have reduced the pragmatic ambiguity by making
    the two trailing sumti values explicit (the ``as perceived by''
    and ``under conditions'' places have been added to the place
    structure of ``xunre''). But assume we have a really stubborn
    listener (an artificially semi-intelligent computer?) who will
    find a way to misinterpret <a href="../5/#3">Example 5.3</a> even
    with three specific sumti provided.</p>

    <p>In this case, we use a sumti tagged with the sumti tcita
    ``ci'u'', which translates roughly as ``on a scale of X'',
    where ``X'' is the sumti. For maximal clarity, the tagged sumti
    can be bound into the negated selbri with ``be''. To clarify <a
    href="../5/#3">Example 5.3</a>, we might say:</p>
<pre>
<a id="5-4"
name="5-4">5.4)</a>  le stizu cu na'e xunre be ci'u loka skari
    The chair is a non-(red on-a-scale-of-colorness)-thing.
</pre>

    <p>We can alternately use the sumti tcita ``teci'e'', based on
    ``ciste'', which translates roughly as ``of a system of
    components X'', for universes of discourse; in this case, we
    would express <a href="../5/#3">Example 5.3</a> as:</p>
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">5.5)</a>  le stizu cu na'e xunre
        be teci'e le skari
    The chair is a non-(red
        of-a-system-with-components-the-colors)-thing.
</pre>

    <p>Other places of ``ciste'' can be brought out using the
    grammar of selma'o BAI modals, allowing slightly different
    forms of expression, thus:</p>
<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">5.6)</a>  le stizu cu na'e xunre
        be ci'e lo'i skari
    The chair is a non-(red
        of-a-system-which-is-the-set-of-colors)-thing.
</pre>

    <p>The cmavo ``le'a'', also in selma'o BAI, can be used to
    specify a category:</p>
<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">5.7)</a>  le stizu cu na'e xunre
        be le'a lo'i skari
    The chair is a non-(red
        of-a-category-which-is-the-set-of-colors)-thing.
</pre>
    which is minimally different in meaning from <a
    href="../5/#6">Example 5.6</a>. 

    <p>The cmavo ``na'e'' is not the only member of selma'o NAhE.
    If we want to express a scalar negation which is a polar
    opposite, we use the cmavo ``to'e'', which is grammatically
    equivalent to ``na'e'':</p>
<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">5.8)</a>  le stizu cu to'e xunre
        be ci'u loka skari
    The chair is a (opposite-of red)
        on-scale a-property-of color-ness.
</pre>

    <p>Likewise, the midpoint of a scale can be expressed with the
    cmavo ``no'e'', also grammatically equivalent to ``na'e''. Here
    are some parallel examples of ``na'e'', ``no'e'', and
    ``to'e'':</p>
<pre>
<a id="9" name="9">5.9)</a>  ta melbi
    That is-beautiful.

<a id="10" name="10">5.10)</a> ta na'e melbi
    That is-non-beautiful.
    That is other than beautiful.
    That is ugly [in one sense].

<a id="11" name="11">5.11)</a> ta no'e melbi
    That is-neutrally beautiful.
    That is plain/ordinary-looking
        (neither ugly nor beautiful).

<a id="12" name="12">5.12)</a> ta to'e melbi
    That is-opposite-of beautiful.
    That is ugly/very ugly/repulsive.
</pre>

    <p>The cmavo ``to'e'' has the assigned rafsi ``-tol-'' and
    ``-to'e-''; the cmavo ``no'e'' has the assigned rafsi ``-nor-''
    and ``-no'e-''. The selbri in <a href="../5/#10">Example 5.10</a>
    through <a href="../5/#12">Example 5.12</a> could be replaced by
    the lujvo ``nalmle'', ``normle'', and ``tolmle''
    respectively.</p>

    <p>This large variety of scalar negations is provided because
    different scales have different properties. Some scales are
    open-ended in both directions: there is no ``ultimately ugly''
    or ``ultimately beautiful''. Other scales, like temperature,
    are open at one end and closed at the other: there is a minimum
    temperature (so-called ``absolute zero'') but no maximum
    temperature. Still other scales are closed at both ends.</p>

    <p>Correspondingly, some selbri have no obvious ``to'e'' ---
    what is the opposite of a dog? --- while others have more than
    one, and need ``ci'u'' to specify which opposite is meant.</p>
