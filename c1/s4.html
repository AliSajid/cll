<h3>4. Disclaimers</h3>

<p>It is necessary to add, alas, that the examples used in this
book do not refer to any existing person, place, or institution,
and that any such resemblance is entirely coincidental and
unintentional, and not intended to give offense.</p>

<p>When definitions and place structures of gismu, and especially
of lujvo, are given in this book, they may differ from those given
in the English-Lojban dictionary (which, as of this writing, is not
yet published). If so, the information given in the dictionary
supersedes whatever is given here.</p>
