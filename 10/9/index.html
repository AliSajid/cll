          <h3>9. Interval properties: TAhE and “roi”</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
     di'i    TAhE                regularly
     na'o    TAhE                typically
     ru'i    TAhE                continuously
     ta'e    TAhE                habitually

     di'inai TAhE                irregularly
     na'onai TAhE                atypically
     ru'inai TAhE                intermittently
     ta'enai TAhE                contrary to habit

     roi     ROI                 “n” times
     roinai  ROI                 other than “n” times

     ze'e    ZEhA                whole time interval
     ve'e    VEhA                whole space interval    
</pre>
    Consider Lojban bridi which express events taking place in
    time. Whether a very short interval (a point) or a long
    interval of time is involved, the event may not be spread
    consistently throughout that interval. Lojban can use the cmavo
    of selma'o TAhE to express the idea of continuous or
    non-continuous actions. 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">9.1)</a>  mi puzu ze'u
        velckule
    I [past] [long distance] [long interval]
        am-a-school-attendee (pupil).
    Long ago I attended school for a long time.
</pre>
    probably does not mean that I attended school continuously
    throughout the whole of that long-ago interval. Actually, I
    attended school every day, except for school holidays. More
    explicitly, 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">9.2)</a>  mi puzu ze'u di'i
        velckule
    I [past] [long distance] [long interval] [regularly]
        am-a-pupil.
    Long ago I regularly attended school for a long time.
</pre>
    The four TAhE cmavo are differentiated as follows: “ru'i”
    covers the entirety of the interval, “di'i” covers the parts
    of the interval which are systematically spaced subintervals;
    “na'o” covers part of the interval, but exactly which part is
    determined by context; “ta'e” covers part of the interval,
    selected with reference to the behavior of the actor (who
    often, but not always, appears in the x1 place of the bridi). 

    <p>Using TAhE does not require being so specific. Either the
    time direction or the time interval or both may be omitted (in
    which case they are vague). For example:</p>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">9.3)</a>  mi ba ta'e klama le zarci
    I [future] [habitually] go-to the market.
    I will habitually go to the market.
    I will make a habit of going to the market.
</pre>
    specifies the future, but the duration of the interval is
    indefinite. Similarly, 
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">9.4)</a>  mi na'o klama le zarci
    I [typically] go-to the market
    I typically go/went/will go to the market
</pre>
    illustrates an interval property in isolation. There are no
    distance or direction cmavo, so the point of time is vague;
    likewise, there is no interval cmavo, so the length of the
    interval during which these goings-to-the-market take place is
    also vague. As always, context will determine these vague
    values. 

    <p>“Intermittently” is the polar opposite notion to
    “continuously”, and is expressed not with its own cmavo, but
    by adding the negation suffix “-nai” (which belongs to
    selma'o NAI) to “ru'i”. For example:</p>
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">9.5)</a>  le verba ru'inai cadzu le bisli
    The child [continuously-not] walks-on the ice.
    The child intermittently walks on the ice.
</pre>
    As shown in the cmavo table above, all the cmavo of TAhE may be
    negated with “-nai”; “ru'inai” and “di'inai” are probably
    the most useful. 

    <p>An intermittent event can also be specified by counting the
    number of times during the interval that it takes place. The
    cmavo “roi” (which belongs to selma'o ROI) can be appended to
    a number to make a quantified tense. Quantified tenses are
    common in English, but not so commonly named: they are
    exemplified by the adverbs “never”, “once”, “twice”,
    “thrice”, ... “always”, and by the related phrases “many
    times”, “a few times”, “too many times”, and so on. All of
    these are handled in Lojban by a number plus “-roi”:</p>
<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">9.6)</a>  mi paroi klama le zarci
    I [one time] go-to the market.
    I go to the market once.

<a id="7" name="7">9.7)</a>   mi du'eroi klama le zarci
    I [too-many times] go-to the market.
    I go to the market too often.
</pre>
    With the quantified tense alone, we don’t know whether the
    past, the present, or the future is intended, but of course the
    quantified tense need not stand alone: 
<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">9.8)</a>  mi pu reroi klama le zarci
    I [past] [two times] go-to the market.
    I went to the market twice.
</pre>
    The English is slightly over-specific here: it entails that
    both goings-to- the-market were in the past, which may or may
    not be true in the Lojban sentence, since the implied interval
    is vague. Therefore, the interval may start in the past but
    extend into the present or even the future. 

    <p>Adding “-nai” to “roi” is also permitted, and has the
    meaning “other than (the number specified)”:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="9" name="9">9.9)</a>  le ratcu reroinai citka le cirli
    The rat [twice-not] eats the cheese.
    The rat eats the cheese other than twice
</pre>

    <p>This may mean that the rat eats the cheese fewer times, or
    more times, or not at all.</p>

    <p>It is necessary to be careful with sentences like <a
    href="../9/#6">Example 9.6</a> and <a href="../9/#8">Example
    9.8</a>, where a quantified tense appears without an interval.
    What <a href="../9/#8">Example 9.8</a> really says is that during
    an interval of unspecified size, at least part of which was set
    in the past, the event of my going to the market happened
    twice. The example says nothing about what happened outside
    that vague time interval. This is often less than we mean. If
    we want to nail down that I went to the market once and only
    once, we can use the cmavo “ze'e” which represents the
    “whole time interval”: conceptually, an interval which
    stretches from time’s beginning to its end:</p>
<pre>
<a id="9-10"
name="9-10">9.10)</a>    mi ze'e paroi klama le zarci
    I [whole interval] [once] go-to the market.
</pre>

    <p>Since specifying no ZEhA leaves the interval vague, <a
    href="../9/#8">Example 9.8</a> might in appropriate context mean
    the same as <a href="../9/#10">Example 9.10</a> after all &mdash; but
    <a href="../9/#10">Example 9.10</a> allows us to be specific when
    specificity is necessary.</p>

    <p>A PU cmavo following “ze'e” has a slightly different
    meaning from one that follows another ZEhA cmavo. The compound
    cmavo “ze'epu” signifies the interval stretching from the
    infinite past to the reference point (wherever the imaginary
    journey has taken you); “ze'eba” is the interval stretching
    from the reference point to the infinite future. The remaining
    form, “ze'eca”, makes specific the “whole of time”
    interpretation just given. These compound forms make it
    possible to assert that something has never happened without
    asserting that it never will.</p>
<pre>
<a id="9-11"
name="9-11">9.11)</a>    mi ze'epu noroi klama le zarci
    I [whole interval] [past] [never] go-to the market.
    I have never gone to the market.
</pre>
    says nothing about whether I might go in future. 

    <p>The space equivalent of “ze'e” is “ve'e”, and it can be
    used in the same way with a quantified space tense: see <a
    href=../11/>Section 11</a> for an explanation of space interval
    modifiers.</p>
