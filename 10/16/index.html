          <h3>16. Tense relations between sentences</h3>

    <p>The sumti tcita method, explained in <a href=../12/>Section
    12</a>, of asserting a tense relationship between two events
    suffers from asymmetry. Specifically,</p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">16.1)</a>    le verba cu cadzu le bisli
        zu'a le nu le nanmu cu batci le gerku
    The child walks-on the ice
        [left] the event-of the man bites the dog.
    The child walks on the ice to the left of where
        the man bites the dog.
</pre>
    which specifies an imaginary journey leftward from the man
    biting the dog to the child walking on the ice, claims only
    that the child walks on the ice. By the nature of “le nu”,
    the man's biting the dog is merely referred to without being
    claimed. If it seems desirable to claim both, each event can be
    expressed as a main sentence bridi, with a special form of
    “.i” connecting them: 
<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">16.2)</a>    le nanmu cu batci le gerku
        .izu'abo le verba cu cadzu le bisli
    The man bites the dog.
        [Left] the child walks-on the ice.
    The  man bites the dog.  To the left, the child
        walks on the ice.
</pre>
    “.izu'abo” is a compound cmavo: the “.i” separates the
    sentences and the “zu'a” is the tense. The “bo” is required
    to prevent the “zu'a” from gobbling up the following sumti,
    namely “le verba”. 

    <p>Note that the bridi in <a href="../16/#2">Example 16.2</a>
    appear in the reverse order from their appearance in <a
    href="../16/#1">Example 16.1</a>. With “.izu'abo” (and all
    other afterthought tense connectives) the sentence specifying
    the origin of the journey comes first. This is a natural order
    for sentences, but requires some care when converting between
    this form and the sumti tcita form.</p>

    <p><a href="../16/#2">Example 16.2</a> means the same thing
    as:</p>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">16.3)</a>    le nanmu cu batci le gerku
        .i zu'a la'edi'u
        le verba cu cadzu le bisli
    The man bites the dog.
        [Left] the-referent-of-the-last-sentence
        the child walks-on the ice.
    The man bites the dog.
        Left of what I just mentioned,
        the child walks on the ice.
</pre>
    If the “bo” is omitted, the meaning changes: 
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">16.4)</a>    le nanmu cu batci le gerku
        .i zu'a le verba cu cadzu le bisli
    The man bites the dog.
         [Left] the child [something] walks-on the ice.
    The man bites the dog. To the left of the child,
        something walks on the ice.
</pre>

    <p>Here the first place of the second sentence is unspecified,
    because “zu'a” has absorbed the sumti “le verba”.</p>

    <p>Do not confuse either <a href="../16/#2">Example 16.2</a> or
    <a href="../16/#4">Example 16.4</a> with the following:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">16.5)</a>    le nanmu cu batci le gerku
        .i zu'aku le verba cu cadzu le bisli
    The man bites the dog.
        [Left] the child walks-on the ice.
    The man bites the dog.  Left of me, the child walks
        on the ice.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="../16/#5">Example 16.5</a>, the origin point is
    the speaker, as is usual with “zu'aku”. <a
    href="../16/#2">Example 16.2</a> makes the origin point of the
    tense the event described by the first sentence.</p>

    <p>Two sentences may also be connected in forethought by a
    tense relationship. Just like afterthought tense connection,
    forethought tense connection claims both sentences, and in
    addition claims that the time or space relationship specified
    by the tense holds between the events the two sentences
    describe.</p>

    <p>The origin sentence is placed first, preceded by a tense
    plus “gi”. Another “gi” is used to separate the
    sentences:</p>
<pre>
<a id="16-6"
name="16-6">16.6)</a>    pugi mi klama le zarci gi mi klama le zdani
    [past] I go-to the market [,] I go-to the house.
    Before I go to the market, I go to the house.
</pre>

    <p>A parallel construction can be used to express a tense
    relationship between sumti:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="16-7"
name="16-7">16.7)</a>    mi klama pugi le zarci gi le zdani
    I go-to [past] the market [,] the house.
</pre>

    <p>Because English does not have any direct way of expressing a
    tense-like relationship between nouns, <a href="../16/#7">Example
    16.7</a> cannot be expressed in English without paraphrasing it
    either into <a href="../16/#6">Example 16.6</a> or else into “I
    go to the house before the market”, which is ambiguous --- is
    the market going?</p>

    <p>Finally, a third forethought construction expresses a tense
    relationship between bridi-tails rather than whole bridi. (The
    construct known as a “bridi-tail” is explained fully in <a
    href="../../14/1/">Chapter 14</a>; roughly speaking, it is a
    selbri with any following sumti.) <a href="../16/#8">Example
    16.8</a> is equivalent in meaning to <a href="../16/#6">Example
    16.6</a> and <a href="../16/#7">Example 16.7</a>:</p>
<pre>
<a id="16-8"
name="16-8">16.8)</a>    mi pugi klama le zarci gi klama le zdani
    I [past] go-to the market [,] go-to the house.
    I, before going to the market, go to the house.
</pre>
    In both <a href="../16/#7">Example 16.7</a> and <a
    href="../16/#8">Example 16.8</a>, the underlying sentences “mi
    klama le zarci” and “mi klama le zdani” are not claimed;
    only the relationship in time between them is claimed. 

    <p>Both the forethought and the afterthought forms are
    appropriate with PU, ZI, FAhA, VA, and ZAhO tenses. In all
    cases, the equivalent forms are (where X and Y stand for
    sentences, and TENSE for a tense cmavo):</p>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>subordinate: X TENSE le nu Y afterthought coordinate: Y
      .i+TENSE+bo X forethought coordinate: TENSE+gi X gi Y</dd>
    </dl>
