<h2>Chapter 10<br />
      Imaginary Journeys: The Lojban Space/Time Tense System</h2>
          <h3>1. Introductory</h3>

    <p>This chapter attempts to document and explain the space/time
    tense system of Lojban. It does not attempt to answer all
    questions of the form “How do I say such-and-such (an English
    tense) in Lojban?” Instead, it explores the Lojban tense
    system from the inside, attempting to educate the reader into a
    Lojbanic viewpoint. Once the overall system is understood and
    the resources that it makes available are familiar, the reader
    should have some hope of using appropriate tense constructs and
    being correctly understood.</p>

    <p>The system of Lojban tenses presented here may seem really
    complex because of all the pieces and all the options; indeed,
    this chapter is the longest one in this book. But tense is in
    fact complex in every language. In your native language, the
    subtleties of tense are intuitive. In foreign languages, you
    are seldom taught the entire system until you have reached an
    advanced level. Lojban tenses are extremely systematic and
    productive, allowing you to express subtleties based on what
    they mean rather than on how they act similarly to English
    tenses. This chapter concentrates on presenting an intuitive
    approach to the meaning of Lojban tense words and how they may
    be creatively and productively combined.</p>

    <p>What is “tense”? Historically, “tense” is the attribute
    of verbs in English and related languages that expresses the
    time of the action. In English, three tenses are traditionally
    recognized, conventionally called the past, the present, and
    the future. There are also a variety of compound tenses used in
    English. However, there is no simple relationship between the
    form of an English tense and the time actually expressed:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>I go to London tomorrow. I will go to London tomorrow. I
      am going to London tomorrow.</dd>
    </dl>
    all mean the same thing, even though the first sentence uses
    the present tense; the second, the future tense; and the third,
    a compound tense usually called “present progressive”.
    Likewise, a newspaper headline says “JONES DIES”, although it
    is obvious that the time referred to must be in the past. Tense
    is a mandatory category of English: every sentence must be
    marked for tense, even if in a way contrary to logic, because
    every main verb has a tense marker built into to it. By
    contrast, Lojban brivla have no implicit or explicit tense
    marker attached to them. 

    <p>In Lojban, the concept of tense extends to every selbri, not
    merely the verb-like ones. In addition, tense structures
    provide information about location in space as well as in time.
    All tense information is optional in Lojban: a sentence
    like:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">1.1)</a>  mi klama le zarci
    I go-to the market.
</pre>
    can be understood as: 

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>I went to the market. I am going to the market. I have
      gone to the market. I will go to the market. I continually go
      to the market.</dd>
    </dl>
    as well as many other possibilities: context resolves which is
    correct. 

    <p>The placement of a tense construct within a Lojban bridi is
    easy: right before the selbri. It goes immediately after the
    “cu”, and can in fact always replace the “cu” (although in
    very complex sentences the rules for eliding terminators may be
    changed as a result). In the following examples, “pu” is the
    tense marker for “past time”:</p>
<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">1.2)</a>  mi cu pu klama le zarci
    mi pu klama le zarci
    I in-the-past go-to the market.
    I went to the market.
</pre>
    It is also possible to put the tense somewhere else in the
    bridi by adding “ku” after it. This “ku” is an elidable
    terminator, but it's almost never possible to actually elide it
    except at the end of the bridi: 
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">1.3)</a>  puku mi klama le zarci
    In-the-past I go-to the market.
    Earlier, I went to the market.

<a id="4" name="4">1.4)</a>   mi klama puku le zarci
    I go-to in-the-past the market.
    I went earlier to the market.

<a id="5" name="5">1.5)</a>   mi klama le zarci pu [ku]
    I go-to the market in-the-past.
    I went to the market earlier.
</pre>
    <a href="../1/#2">Examples 1.2</a> through <a
    href="../1/#5">1.5</a> are different only in emphasis. Abnormal
    order, such as <a href="../1/#3">Examples 1.3</a> through <a
    href="../1/#5">1.5</a> exhibit, adds emphasis to the words that
    have been moved; in this case, the tense cmavo “pu”. Words at
    either end of the sentence tend to be more noticeable.
