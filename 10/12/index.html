          <h3>12. Tenses as sumti tcita</h3>

    <p>So far, we have seen tenses only just before the selbri, or
    (equivalently in meaning) floating about the bridi with “ku”.
    There is another major use for tenses in Lojban: as sumti
    tcita, or argument tags. A tense may be used to add spatial or
    temporal information to a bridi as, in effect, an additional
    place:
<pre>
<a id="Example1">12.1)</a>  mi klama le zarci ca le nu do klama le zdani
       I go-to the market [present] the event-of you go-to the house.
       I go to the market when you go to the house.
</pre>

    Here “ca” does not appear before the selbri, nor with “ku”;
    instead, it governs the following sumti, the “le nu”
    construct. What <a href="../12/#1">Example 12.1</a> asserts is
    that the action of the main bridi is happening at the same time
    as the event mentioned by that sumti. So “ca”, which means
    “now” when used with a selbri, means “simultaneously-with”
    when used with a sumti. Consider another example: 

<pre>
<a id="Example2">12.2)</a>  mi klama le zarci pu le nu
             do pu klama le zdani
       I go-to the market [past] the event-of
             you [past] go-to the house.
</pre>

    The second “pu” is simply the past tense marker for the
    event of your going to the house, and says that this event is
    in the speaker’s past. How are we to understand the first
    “pu”, the sumti tcita?</p>

    <p>All of our imaginary journeys so far have started at the
    speaker’s location in space and time. Now we are specifying an
    imaginary journey that starts at a different location, namely
    at the event of your going to the house. <a
    href="../12/#2">Example 12.2</a> then says that my going to the
    market is in the past, relative not to the speaker’s present
    moment, but instead relative to the moment when you went to the
    house. <a href="../12/#2">Example 12.2</a> can therefore be
    translated:

<pre>
       I had gone to the market before you went to the house.
</pre>

    (Other translations are possible, depending on the ever-present
    context.) Spatial direction and distance sumti tcita are
    exactly analogous: 

<pre>
<a id="3"
name="3">12.3)</a>  le ratcu cu citka le cirla vi le panka
       The rat eats the cheese [short distance] the park.
       The rat eats the cheese near the park.

<a id="Example4">12.4)</a>  le ratcu cu citka le cirla vi le vu panka
       The rat eats the cheese [short distance] the [long distance] park
       The rat eats the cheese near the faraway park.

<a id="Example5">12.5)</a>  le ratcu cu citka le cirla vu le vi panka
       The rat eats the cheese [long distance] the [short distance] park
       The rat eats the cheese far away from the nearby park.
</pre>

    The event contours of selma'o ZAhO (and their space
    equivalents, prefixed with “fe'e”) are also useful as sumti
    tcita. The interpretation of ZAhO tcita differs from that of
    FAhA, VA, PU, and ZI tcita, however. The event described in the
    sumti is viewed as a process, and the action of the main bridi
    occurs at the phase of the process which the ZAhO specifies, or
    at least some part of that phase. The action of the main bridi
    itself is seen as a point event, so that there is no issue
    about which phase of the main bridi is intended. For example: 

<pre>
<a id="6"
name="6">12.6)</a>  mi morsi ba'o le nu mi jmive
       I am-dead [perfective] the event-of I live.
       I die in the aftermath of my living.
</pre>

    Here the (point-)event of my being dead is the portion of my
    living-process which occurs after the process is complete.
    Contrast <a href="../12/#6">Example 12.6</a> with:

<pre>
<a id="Example7">12.7)</a>  mi morsi ba le nu mi jmive
       I am-dead [future] the event-of I live.
</pre>

    As explained in <a href=../6/>Section 6</a>, <a
    href="../12/#7">Example 12.7</a> does not exclude the possibility
    that I died before I ceased to live!</p>

    <p>Likewise, we might say:
    Ü
<pre>
<a id="8"
name="8">12.8)</a>  mi klama le zarci pu'o le nu mi citka
       I go-to the store [inchoative] the event-of I eat
</pre>

    which indicates that before my eating begins, I go to the
    store, whereas 

<pre>
<a id="9"
name="9">12.9)</a>  mi klama le zarci ba'o le nu mi citka
       I go-to the store [perfective] the event-of I eat
</pre>

    would indicate that I go to the store after I am finished
    eating.</p>

    <p>Here is an example which mixes temporal ZAhO (as a tense)
    and spatial ZAhO (as a sumti tcita):

<pre>
<a id="Example10">12.10)</a> le bloti pu za'o xelklama
             fe'e ba'o le lalxu
       The boat [past] [superfective]
             is-a-transport-mechanism
             [space] [perfective] the lake.
       The boat sailed for too long and beyond the lake.
</pre>

    Probably it sailed up onto the dock. One point of
    clarification: although “xelklama” appears to mean simply
    “is-a-mode-of-transport”, it does not -- the bridi of <a
    href="../12/#10">Example 12.10</a> has four omitted arguments,
    and thus has the (physical) journey which goes on too long as
    part of its meaning.</p>

    <p>The remaining tense cmavo, which have to do with interval
    size, dimension, and continuousness (or lack thereof) are
    interpreted to let the sumti specify the particular interval
    over which the main bridi operates:

<pre>
<a id="11"
name="11">12.11)</a> mi klama le zarci reroi le ca djedi
       I go-to the market [twice] the [present] day.
       I go/went/will go to the market twice today.
</pre>

    Be careful not to confuse a tense used as a sumti tcita with a
    tense used within a seltcita sumti: 

<pre>
<a id="Example12">12.12)</a> loi snime cu carvi ze'u le ca dunra
       Some-of-the-mass-of snow rains [long time interval] the [present] winter.
       Snow falls during this winter.
</pre>

    claims that the interval specified by “this winter” is long,
    as events of snowfall go, whereas

<pre>
<a id="Example13">12.13)</a> loi snime cu carvi ca le ze'u dunra
       Some-of-the-mass-of snow rains [present] the [long time] winter.
       Snow falls in the long winter.
</pre>

    claims that during some part of the winter, which is long as
    winters go, snow falls.</p>
