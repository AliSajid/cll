          <h3>10. Event contours: ZAhO and “re'u”</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:

<pre>
     pu'o    ZAhO                inchoative
     ca'o    ZAhO                continuitive
     ba'o    ZAhO                perfective
     co'a    ZAhO                initiative
     co'u    ZAhO                cessitive
     mo'u    ZAhO                completitive
     za'o    ZAhO                superfective
     co'i    ZAhO                achievative
     de'a    ZAhO                pausative
     di'a    ZAhO                resumptive
     re'u    ROI                 ordinal tense
</pre>
</p>

    <p>The cmavo of selma'o ZAhO express the Lojban version of what is
    traditionally called “aspect”. This is not a notion well
    expressed by English tenses, but many languages (including
    Chinese and Russian among Lojban’s six source languages)
    consider it more important than the specification of mere
    position in time.</p>

    <p>The “event contours” of selma'o ZAhO, with their bizarre
    keywords, represent the natural portions of an event considered
    as a process, an occurrence with an internal structure
    including a beginning, a middle, and an end. Since the keywords
    are scarcely self-explanatory, each ZAhO will be explained in
    detail here. Note that from the viewpoint of Lojban syntax,
    ZAhOs are interval modifiers like TAhEs or ROI compounds; if
    both are found in a single tense, the TAhE/ROI comes first and
    the ZAhO afterward. The imaginary journey described by other
    tense cmavo moves us to the portion of the event-as-process
    which the ZAhO specifies.</p>

    <p>It is important to understand that ZAhO cmavo, unlike the
    other tense cmavo, specify characteristic portions of the
    event, and are seen from an essentially timeless perspective.
    The “beginning” of an event is the same whether the event is
    in the speaker’s present, past, or future. It is especially
    important not to confuse the speaker-relative viewpoint of the
    PU tenses with the event-relative viewpoint of the ZAhO
    tenses.</p>

    <p>The cmavo “pu'o”, “ca'o”, and “ba'o” (etymologically
    derived from the PU cmavo) refer to an event that has not yet
    begun, that is in progress, or that has ended,
    respectively:

<pre>
<a id="Example1">10.1)</a>  mi pu'o damba
       I [inchoative] fight.
       I’m on the verge of fighting.

<a id="Example2">10.2)</a>  la stiv. ca'o bacru
       Steve [continuitive] utters.
       Steve continues to talk.

<a id="Example3">10.3)</a>  le verba ba'o cadzu le bisli
       The child [perfective] walks-on the ice.
       The child is finished walking on the ice.
</pre>

    As discussed in <a href=../6/>Section 6</a>, the simple PU
    cmavo make no assumptions about whether the scope of a past,
    present, or future event extends into one of the other tenses
    as well. <a href="../10/#Example1">Examples 10.1</a> through <a
    href="../10/#3">10.3</a> illustrate that these ZAhO cmavo do make
    such assumptions possible: the event in 10.1 has not yet begun,
    definitively; likewise, the event in 10.3 is definitely over.</p>

    <p>Note that in <a href="../10/#Example1">Example 10.1</a> and <a
    href="../10/#3">Example 10.3</a>, “pu'o” and “ba'o” may
    appear to be reversed: “pu'o”, although etymologically
    connected with “pu”, is referring to a future event; whereas
    “ba'o”, connected with “ba”, is referring to a past event.
    This is the natural result of the event-centered view of ZAhO
    cmavo. The inchoative, or “pu'o”, part of an event, is in the
    “pastward” portion of that event, when seen from the
    perspective of the event itself. It is only by inference that
    we suppose that <a href="../10/#Example1">Example 10.1</a> refers to the
    speaker’s future: in fact, no PU tense is given, so the
    inchoative part of the event need not be coincident with the
    speaker’s present: “pu'o” is not necessarily, though in fact
    often is, the same as “ca pu'o”.</p>

    <p>The cmavo in <a href="../10/#Example1">Examples 10.1</a> through <a
    href="../10/#3">10.3</a> refer to spans of time. There are also
    two points of time that can be usefully associated with an
    event: the beginning, marked by “co'a”, and the end, marked
    by “co'u”. Specifically, “co'a” marks the boundary between
    the “pu'o” and “ca'o” parts of an event, and “co'u” marks
    the boundary between the “ca'o” and “ba'o” parts:

<pre>
<a id="Example4">10.4)</a>  mi ba co'a citka le mi sanmi
       I [future] [initiative] eat my meal.
       I will begin to eat my meal.

<a id="Example5">10.5)</a>  mi pu co'u citka le mi sanmi
       I [past] [cessitive] eat my meal.
       I ceased eating my meal.
</pre>

    Compare <a href="../10/#Example4">Example 10.4</a> with:

<pre>
<a id="Example6">10.6)</a>  mi ba di'i co'a bajra
       I [future] [regularly] [initiative] run.
       I will regularly begin to run.
</pre>

    which illustrates the combination of a TAhE with a ZAhO.</p>

    <p>A process can have two end points, one reflecting the
    “natural end” (when the process is complete) and the other
    reflecting the “actual stopping point” (whether complete or
    not). <a href="../10/#Example5">Example 10.5</a> may be contrasted
    with:

<pre>
<a id="Example7">10.7)</a>  mi pu mo'u citka le mi sanmi
       I [past] [completitive] eat my meal.
       I finished eating my meal.
</pre>

    In <a href="../10/#Example7">Example 10.7</a>, the meal has reached
    its natural end; in <a href="../10/#Example5">Example 10.5</a>, the meal
    has merely ceased, without necessarily reaching its natural
    end.</p>

    <p>A process such as eating a meal does not necessarily proceed
    uninterrupted. If it is interrupted, there are two more
    relevant point events: the point just before the interruption,
    marked by “de'a”, and the point just after the interruption,
    marked by “di'a”. Some examples:

<pre>
<a id="Example8">10.8)</a>  mi pu de'a citka le mi sanmi
       I [past] [pausative] eat my meal.
       I stopped eating my meal (with the intention of resuming).

<a id="Example9">10.9)</a>  mi ba di'a citka le mi sanmi
       I [future] [resumptive] eat my meal.
       I will resume eating my meal.
</pre>

    In addition, it is possible for a process to continue beyond
    its natural end. The span of time between the natural and the
    actual end points is represented by “za'o”: 

<pre>
<a id="Example10">10.10)</a> le xirma ca za'o jivna bajra
       The horse [present] [superfective] compete-type-of runs.
       The horse keeps on running a race too long.
</pre>

    which means that it ran past the finish line (after the race
    was over &mdash; in most races, the runners do not stop right at
    the finish line).</p>

    <p>An entire event can be treated as a single moment using the
    cmavo “co'i”:

<pre>
<a id="Example11">10.11)</a> la djan. pu co'i catra la djim
       John [past] [achievative] kills Jim.
       John was at the point in time where he killed Jim.
</pre>

    Finally, since an activity is cyclical, an individual cycle can
    be referred to using a number followed by “re'u”, which is
    the other cmavo of selma'o ROI:

<pre>
<a id="Example12">10.12)</a> mi pare'u klama le zarci
       I [first time] go-to the store.
       I go to the store for the first time (within a vague interval).
</pre>

    Note the difference between:

<pre>
<a id="Example13">10.13)</a> mi pare'u paroi klama le zarci
       I [first time] [one time] go-to the store.
       For the first time, I go to the store once.
</pre>

    and

<pre>
<a id="Example14">10.14)</a> mi paroi pare'u klama le zarci
       I [one time] [first time] go-to the store.
       There is one occasion on which I go to the store for the first time.
</pre>
</p>
