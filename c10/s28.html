    <h3><a id="s28" name="s28">28. List of spatial directions and direction-like
    relations</h3>

    <p>The following list of FAhA cmavo gives rough English glosses
    for the cmavo, first when used without ``mo'i'' to express a
    direction, and then when used with ``mo'i'' to express movement
    in the direction. When possible, the gismu from which the cmavo
    is derived is also listed.</p>

    from the speaker's location, or whatever the origin is.</p>

    <p>``fa'a'' and ``to'o'' refer to direction towards or away
    from some other point.</p>
