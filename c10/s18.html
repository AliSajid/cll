    <h3><a id="s18" name="s18">18. Tense negation</h3>

    <p>Any bridi which involves tenses of selma'o PU, FAhA, or ZAhO
    can be contradicted by a ``-nai'' suffixed to the tense cmavo.
    Some examples:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e18d1" name="e18d1">18.1)</a>    mi punai klama le zarci
    I [past] [not] go-to the market.
    I didn't go to the market.
</pre>
    As a contradictory negation, <a href="#e18d1">Example 18.1</a>
    implies that the bridi as a whole is false without saying
    anything about what is true. When the negated tense is a sumti
    tcita, ``-nai'' negation indicates that the stated relationship
    does not hold: 
<pre>
<a id="e18d2"
name="e18d2">18.2)</a>    mi klama le zarci canai le nu
        do klama le zdani
    I go-to the market [present] [not] the event-of
        you go-to the house.
    It is not true that I went to the market at the same
        time that you went to the house.

<a id="e18d3"
name="e18d3">18.3)</a> le nanmu batci le gerku ne'inai le kumfa
    The man bites the dog [within] [not] the room.
    The man didn't bite the dog inside the room.

<a id="e18d4"
name="e18d4">18.4)</a> mi morsi ca'onai le nu mi jmive
    I am-dead [continuitive - negated] the event-of I live.
    It is false that I am dead during my life.
</pre>
    It is also possible to perform scalar negation of whole tense
    constructs by placing a member of NAhE before them. Unlike
    contradictory negation, scalar negation asserts a truth: that
    the bridi is true with some tense other than that specified.
    The following examples are scalar negation analogues of <a
    href="#e18d1">Examples 18.1</a> to <a href="#e18d3">18.3</a>:
    
<pre>
<a id="e18d5" name="e18d5">18.5)</a>    mi na'e pu klama le zarci
    I [non-] [past] go-to the market.
    I go to the market other than in the past.

<a id="e18d6"
name="e18d6">18.6)</a> le nanmu batci le gerku to'e ne'i le kumfa
    The man bites the dog [opposite-of] [within] the room.
    The man bites the dog outside the room.

<a id="e18d7"
name="e18d7">18.7)</a> mi klama le zarci na'e ca le nu
        do klama le zdani
    I go-to the market [non-] [present] the event-of
        you go-to the house.
    I went to the market at a time other than the time at
        which you went to the house.

<a id="e18d8"
name="e18d8">18.8)</a> mi morsi na'e ca'o le nu mi jmive
    I am-dead [non-] [continuitive] the event-of I live.
    I am dead other than during my life.
</pre>
    Unlike ``-nai'' contradictory negation, scalar negation of
    tenses is not limited to PU and FAhA: 
<pre>
<a id="e18d9"
name="e18d9">18.9)</a>    le verba na'e ri'u cadzu le bisli
    The child [non-] [right] walks-on the ice
    The child walks on the ice other than to my right.
</pre>
    The use of ``-nai'' on cmavo of TAhE and ROI has already been
    discussed in <a href="s9.html">Section 9</a>; this use is also a
    scalar negation.
