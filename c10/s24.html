    <h3><a id="s24" name="s24">24. Tense questions: ``cu'e''</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo is discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   cu'e    CUhE    tense question
</pre>
    There are two main ways to ask questions about tense. The main
    English tense question words are ``When?'' and ``Where?''.
    These may be paraphrased respectively as ``At what time?'' and
    ``At what place?'' In these forms, their Lojban equivalents
    simply involve a tense plus ``ma'', the Lojban sumti question: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e24d1" name="e24d1">24.1)</a>    do klama le zdani ca ma
    you go-to the house [present] [what sumti?].
    You go to the house at what time?
    When do you go to the house?
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="e24d2" name="e24d2">24.2)</a>    le verba vi ma pu
        cadzu le bisli
    The child [short space] [what sumti?] [past]
        walks-on the ice.
    The child at/near what place walked on the ice?
    Where did the child walk on the ice?
</pre>
    There is also a non-specific tense and modal question,
    ``cu'e'', belonging to selma'o CUhE. This can be used wherever
    a tense or modal construct can be used. 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e24d3"
name="e24d3">24.3)</a>    le nanmu cu'e batci le gerku
    The man [what tense?] bites the dog.
    When/Where/How does the man bite the dog?
</pre>
    Possible answers to <a href="#e24d3">Example 24.3</a> might be:
    
<pre>
<a id="e24d4" name="e24d4">24.4)</a>    va
    [medium space].
    Some ways from here.

<a id="e24d5" name="e24d5">24.5)</a> puzu
    [past] [long time].
    A long time ago.

<a id="e24d6" name="e24d6">24.6)</a> vi le lunra
    [short space] The moon.
    On the moon.

<a id="e24d7" name="e24d7">24.7)</a> pu'o
    [inchoative]
    He hasn't yet done so.
</pre>
    or even the modal reply (from selma'o BAI; see <a
    href="../c9/s1.html">Chapter 9</a>): 
<pre>
<a id="e24d8" name="e24d8">24.8)</a>    bai la djan.
    Under John's compulsion.
</pre>
    The only way to combine ``cu'e'' with other tense cmavo is
    through logical connection, which makes a question that
    pre-specifies some information: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e24d9"
name="e24d9">24.9)</a>    do puzi je cu'e sombo le gurni
    You [past] [short] and [when?] sow the grain?
    You sowed the grain a little while ago;
        when else do you sow it?
</pre>

    <p>Additionally, the logical connective itself can be replaced
    by a question word:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e24d10"
name="e24d10">24.10)</a>  la .artr. pu je'i ba nolraitru
    Arthur [past] [which?] [future] is-a-king
    Was Arthur a king or will he be?
</pre>

    <p>Answers to <a href="#e24d10">Example 24.10</a> would be
    logical connectives such as ``je'', meaning ``both'', ``naje''
    meaning ``the latter'', or ``jenai'' meaning ``the
    former''.</p>

    <p></p>
