    <h3><a id="s25" name="s25">25. Explicit magnitudes</h3>

    <p>It is a limitation of the VA and ZI system of specifying
    magnitudes that they can only prescribe vague magnitudes:
    small, medium, or large. In order to express both an origin
    point and an exact distance, the Lojban construction called a
    ``termset'' is employed. (Termsets are explained further in <a
    href="../c14/s1.html">Chapter 14</a> and <a
    href="../c16/s1.html">Chapter 16</a>.) It is grammatical for a
    termset to be placed after a tense or modal tag rather than a
    sumti, which allows both the origin of the imaginary journey
    and its distance to be specified. Here is an example:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e25d1"
name="e25d1">25.1)</a>    la frank. sanli zu'a nu'i la djordj.
        lu'a lo mitre
            be li mu [nu'u]
    Frank stands [left] [start termset] George
        [quantity] a thing-measuring-in-meters
            the-number 5 [end termset].
    Frank is standing five meters to the left of George.
</pre>

    <p>Here the termset extends from the ``nu'i'' to the implicit
    ``nu'u'' at the end of the sentence, and includes the terms
    ``la djordj.'', which is the unmarked origin point, and the
    tagged sumti ``lo mitre be li mu'', which the cmavo ``la'u''
    (of selma'o BAI, and meaning ``with quantity''; see <a
    href="../c9/s1.html">Chapter 9</a>) marks as a quantity. Both
    terms are governed by the tag ``zu'a''</p>

    <p>It is not necessary to have both an origin point and an
    explicit magnitude: a termset may have only a single term in
    it. A less precise version of <a href="#e25d1">Example 25.1</a>
    is:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e25d2"
name="e25d2">25.2)</a>    la frank. sanli zu'a nu'i lu'a
        lo mitre be li mu
    Frank stands [left] [termset] [quantity]
        a thing-measuring-in-meters the-number 5.
    Frank stands five meters to the left.
