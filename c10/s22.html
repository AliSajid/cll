    <h3><a id="s22" name="s22">22. Conversion of sumti tcita: JAI</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   jai JAI tense conversion
    fai FA  indefinite place
</pre>
    Conversion is the regular Lojban process of moving around the
    places of a place structure. The cmavo of selma'o SE serve this
    purpose, exchanging the first place with one of the others: 
<pre>
<a id="e22d1" name="e22d1">22.1)</a>    mi cu klama le zarci
    I go-to the market.

<a id="e22d2" name="e22d2">22.2)</a> le zarci cu se klama mi
    The market is-gone-to by-me.
</pre>
    It is also possible to bring a place that is specified by a
    sumti tcita (for the purposes of this chapter, a tense sumti
    tcita) to the front, by using ``jai'' plus the tense as the
    grammatical equivalent of SE: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e22d3"
name="e22d3">22.3)</a>    le ratcu cu citka le cirla vi le panka
    The rat eats the cheese [short distance] the park.
    The rat eats the cheese in the park.

<a id="e22d4"
name="e22d4">22.4)</a> le panka cu jai vi citka le cirla fai le ratcu
    The park is-the-place-of eating the cheese by-the rat.
    The park is where the rat eats the cheese.
</pre>
    In <a href="#e22d4">Example 22.4</a>, the construction
    JAI+tense converts the location sumti into the first place. The
    previous first place has nowhere to go, since the location
    sumti is not a numbered place; however, it can be inserted back
    into the bridi with ``fai'', the indefinite member of selma'o
    FA. 

    <p>(The other members of FA are used to mark the first, second,
    etc. places of a bridi explicitly:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e22d5" name="e22d5">22.5)</a>    fa mi cu klama fe le zarci
</pre>
    means the same as 
<pre>
<a id="e22d6" name="e22d6">22.6)</a>    fe le zarci cu klama fa mi
</pre>
    as well as the simple 
<pre>
<a id="e22d7" name="e22d7">22.7)</a>    mi cu klama le zarci
</pre>
    in which the place structure is determined by position.) 

    <p>Like SE conversion, JAI+tense conversion is especially
    useful in descriptions with LE selma'o:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e22d8"
name="e22d8">22.8)</a>    mi viska le jai vi citka be le cirla
    I saw the place-of eating the cheese.
</pre>

    <p>Here the eater of the cheese is elided, so no ``fai''
    appears.</p>

    <p>Of course, temporal tenses are also usable with JAI:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e22d9" name="e22d9">22.9)</a>    mi djuno fi le jai ca morsi
        be fai la djan.
    I know about the [present] is-dead
        of-the-one-called ``John''
    I know the time of John's death.
    I know when John died.
</pre>
