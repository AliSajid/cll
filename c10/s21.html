    <h3><a id="s21" name="s21">21. Sub-events</h3>

    <p>Another application of non-logical tense connection is to
    talk about sub-events of events. Consider a six-shooter: a gun
    which can fire six bullets in succession before reloading. If I
    fire off the entire magazine twice, I can express the fact in
    Lojban thus:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e21d1" name="e21d1">21.1)</a>    mi reroi pi'u xaroi
        cecla le seldanti
    I [twice] [cross-product] [six times]
        shoot the projectile-launcher.
    On two occasions, I fire the gun six times.
</pre>
    It would be confusing, though grammatical, to run the ``reroi''
    and the ``xaroi'' directly together. However, the non-logical
    connective ``pi'u'' expresses a Cartesian product (also known
    as a cross product) of two sets. In this case, there is a set
    of two firings each of which is represented by a set of six
    shots, for twelve shots in all (hence the name ``product'': the
    product of 2 and 6 is 12). Its use specifies very precisely
    what occurs. 

    <p>In fact, you can specify strings of interval properties and
    event contours within a single tense without the use of a
    logical or non-logical connective cmavo. This allows tenses of
    the type:</p>
