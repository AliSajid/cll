    <h3><a id="s8" name="s8">8. Movement in space: MOhI</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo is discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   mo'i    MOhI    movement flag
</pre>
    All the information carried by the tense constructs so far
    presented has been presumed to be static: the bridi is
    occurring somewhere or other in space and time, more or less
    remote from the speaker. Suppose the truth of the bridi itself
    depends on the result of a movement, or represents an action
    being done while the speaker is moving? This too can be
    represented by the tense system, using the cmavo ``mo'i'' (of
    selma'o MOhI) plus a spatial direction and optional distance;
    the direction now refers to a direction of motion rather than a
    static direction from the speaker.

<pre>
<a id="e8d1"
name="e8d1">8.1)</a>  le verba mo'i ri'u cadzu le bisli
    The child [movement] [right] walks-on the ice.
    The child walks toward my right on the ice.
</pre>

    <p>This is quite different from:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e8d2" name="e8d2">8.2)</a>  le verba ri'u cadzu le bisli
    The child [right] walks-on the ice.
    To the right of me, the child walks on the ice.
</pre>
    In either case, however, the reference frame for defining
    ``right'' and ``left'' is the speaker's, not the child's. This
    can be changed thus: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e8d3"
name="e8d3">8.3)</a>  le verba mo'i ri'u cadzu le bisli
        ma'i vo'a
    The child [movement] [right] walks on the ice
        in-reference-frame the-x1-place.
    The child walks toward her right on the ice.
</pre>
    <a href="#e8d3">Example 8.3</a> is analogous to <a
    href="#e8d1">Example 8.1</a>. The cmavo ``ma'i'' belongs to
    selma'o BAI (explained in <a href="../c9/s1.html">Chapter 9</a>),
    and allows specifying a reference frame. 

    <p>Both a regular and a ``mo'i''-flagged spatial tense can be
    combined, with the ``mo'i'' construct coming last:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e8d4" name="e8d4">8.4)</a>  le verba zu'avu mo'i ri'uvi
        cadzu le bisli
    The child [left] [long] [movement] [right] [short]
        walks-on the ice.
    Far to the left of me, the child walks a short
        distance toward my right on the ice.
</pre>
    It is not grammatical to use multiple directions like ``zu'a
    ca'u'' after ``mo'i'', but complex movements can be expressed
    in a separate bridi. 

    <p>Here is an example of a movement tense on a bridi not
    inherently involving movement:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e8d5" name="e8d5">8.5)</a>  mi mo'i ca'uvu citka le mi sanmi
    I [movement] [front] [long] eat my meal.
    While moving a long way forward, I eat my meal.
</pre>
    (Perhaps I am eating in an airplane.) 

    <p>There is no parallel facility in Lojban at present for
    expressing movement in time --- time travel --- but one could
    be added easily if it ever becomes useful.</p>
