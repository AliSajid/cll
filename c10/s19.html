    <h3><a id="s19" name="s19">19. Actuality, potentiality, capability: CAhA</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   ca'a    CAhA    actually is
    ka'e    CAhA    is innately capable of
    nu'o    CAhA    can but has not
    pu'i    CAhA    can and has
</pre>
    Lojban bridi without tense markers may not necessarily refer to
    actual events: they may also refer to capabilities or potential
    events. For example: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e19d1" name="e19d1">19.1)</a>    ro datka cu flulimna
    all ducks are-float-swimmers
    All ducks swim by floating.
</pre>
    is a Lojban truth, even though the colloquial English
    translation is false or at best ambiguous. This is because the
    tenseless Lojban bridi doesn't necessarily claim that every
    duck is swimming or floating now or even at a specific time or
    place. Even if we add a tense marker to <a
    href="#e19d1">Example 19.1</a>, 
<pre>
<a id="e19d2" name="e19d2">19.2)</a>    ro datka ca flulimna
    all ducks [present] are-float-swimmers.
    All ducks are now swimming by floating.
</pre>
    the resulting <a href="#e19d2">Example 19.2</a> might still be
    considered a truth, even though the colloquial English seems
    even more likely to be false. All ducks have the potential of
    swimming even if they are not exercising that potential at
    present. To get the full flavor of ``All ducks are now
    swimming'', we must append a marker from selma'o CAhA to the
    tense, and say: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e19d3" name="e19d3">19.3)</a>    ro datka ca ca'a flulimna
    all ducks [present] [actual] are-float-swimmers
    All ducks are now actually swimming by floating.
</pre>
    A CAhA cmavo is always placed after any other tense cmavo,
    whether for time or for space. However, a CAhA cmavo comes
    before ``ki'', so that a CAhA condition can be made sticky. 

    <p><a href="#e19d3">Example 19.3</a> is false in both Lojban
    and English, since it claims that the swimming is an actual,
    present fact, true of every duck that exists, whereas in fact
    there is at least one duck that is not swimming now.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, some ducks are dead (and therefore sink); some
    ducks have just hatched (and do not know how to swim yet), and
    some ducks have been eaten by predators (and have ceased to
    exist as separate objects at all). Nevertheless, all these
    ducks have the innate capability of swimming --- it is part of
    the nature of duckhood. The cmavo ``ka'e'' expresses this
    notion of innate capability:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e19d4" name="e19d4">19.4)</a>    ro datka ka'e flulimna
    all ducks [capable] are-float-swimmers.
    All ducks are innately capable of swimming.
</pre>
    Under some epistemologies, innate capability can be extended in
    order to apply the innate properties of a mass to which certain
    individuals belong to the individuals themselves, even if those
    individuals are themselves not capable of fulfilling the claim
    of the bridi. For example: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e19d5" name="e19d5">19.5)</a>    la djan. ka'e viska
    John [capable] sees.
    John is innately capable of seeing.
    John can see.
</pre>
    might be true about a human being named John, even though he
    has been blind since birth, because the ability to see is
    innately built into his nature as a human being. It is
    theoretically possible that conditions might occur that would
    enable John to see (a great medical discovery). On the other
    hand, 
<pre>
<a id="e19d6" name="e19d6">19.6)</a>    le cukta ka'e viska
    The book [capable] sees.
    The book can see.
</pre>
    is not true in most epistemologies, since the ability to see is
    not part of the innate nature of a book. 

    <p>Consider once again the newly hatched ducks mentioned
    earlier. They have the potential of swimming, but have not yet
    demonstrated that potential. This may be expressed using
    ``nu'o'', the cmavo of CAhA for undemonstrated potential:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e19d7" name="e19d7">19.7)</a>    ro cifydatka nu'o flulimna
    all infant-ducks [can but has not] are-float-swimmers.
    All infant ducks have an undemonstrated potential
        for swimming by floating.
    Baby ducks can swim but haven't yet.
</pre>
    Contrariwise, if Frank is not blind from birth, then ``pu'i''
    is appropriate: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e19d8" name="e19d8">19.8)</a>    la frank. pu'i viska
    Frank [can and has] sees.
    Frank has demonstrated a potential for seeing.
    Frank can see and has seen.
</pre>
    Note that the glosses given at the beginning of this section
    for ``ca'a'', ``nu'o'', and ``pu'i'' incorporate ``ca'' into
    their meaning, and are really correct for ``ca ca'a'', ``ca
    nu'o'', and ``ca pu'i''. However, the CAhA cmavo are perfectly
    meaningful with other tenses than the present: 
<pre>
<a id="e19d9" name="e19d9">19.9)</a>    mi pu ca'a klama le zarci
    I [past] [actual] go-to the store.
    I actually went to the store.

<a id="e19d10"
name="e19d10">19.10)</a>   la frank. pu nu'o klama le zdani
    Frank [past] [can but has not] goes-to the store.
    Frank could have, but will not have, gone to the
        store (at some understood moment in the
        future).
</pre>
    As always in Lojban tenses, a missing CAhA can have an
    indeterminate meaning, or the context can be enough to
    disambiguate it. Saying 
<pre>
<a id="e19d11" name="e19d11">19.11)</a>  ta jelca
    That burns/is-burning/might-burn/will-burn.
</pre>
    with no CAhA specified can translate the two very different
    English sentences ``That is on fire'' and ``That is
    inflammable.'' The first demands immediate action (usually),
    whereas the second merely demands caution. The two cases can be
    disambiguated with: 
<pre>
<a id="e19d12" name="e19d12">19.12)</a>  ta ca ca'a jelca
    That [present] [actual] burns.
    That is on fire.
</pre>
    and 
<pre>
<a id="e19d13" name="e19d13">19.13)</a>  ta ka'e jelca
    That [capable] burns.
    That is capable of burning.
    That is inflammable.
</pre>
    When no indication is given, as in the simple observative 
<pre>
<a id="e19d14" name="e19d14">19.14)</a>  fagri
    fire
</pre>
    the prudent Lojbanist will assume the meaning ``Fire!''
