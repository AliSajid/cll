          <h3><a id="15" name="15">15. Cultural and other non-algorithmic gismu</h3>

    <p>The following gismu were not made by the gismu creation
    algorithm. They are, in effect, coined words similar to
    fu'ivla. They are exceptions to the otherwise mandatory gismu
    creation algorithm where there was sufficient justification for
    such exceptions. Except for the small metric prefixes and the
    assignable predicates beginning with ``brod-'', they all end in
    the letter ``o'', which is otherwise a rare letter in Lojban
    gismu.</p>

    <p>The following gismu represent concepts that are sufficiently
    unique to Lojban that they were either coined from combining
    forms of other gismu, or else made up out of whole cloth. These
    gismu are thus conceptually similar to lujvo even though they
    are only five letters long; however, unlike lujvo, they have
    rafsi assigned to them for use in building more complex lujvo.
    Assigning gismu to these concepts helps to keep the resulting
    lujvo reasonably short.</p>
<pre>
   broda       1st assignable predicate
    brode       2nd assignable predicate
    brodi       3rd assignable predicate
    brodo       4th assignable predicate
    brodu       5th assignable predicate
    cmavo       structure word (from ``cmalu valsi'')
    lojbo       Lojbanic (from ``logji bangu'')
    lujvo       compound word (from ``pluja valsi'')
    mekso       Mathematical EXpression
</pre>

    <p>It is important to understand that even though ``cmavo'',
    ``lojbo'', and ``lujvo'' were made up from parts of other
    gismu, they are now full-fledged gismu used in exactly the same
    way as all other gismu, both in grammar and in word
    formation.</p>

    <p>The following three groups of gismu represent concepts drawn
    from the international language of science and mathematics.
    They are used for concepts that are represented in most
    languages by a root which is recognized internationally.</p>

    <p>Small metric prefixes (less than 1):</p>
<pre>
   decti       .1/deci
    centi       .01/centi   
    milti       .001/milli
    mikri       1E-6/micro
    nanvi       1E-9/nano
    picti       1E-12/pico
    femti       1E-15/femto 
    xatsi       1E-18/atto
    zepti       1E-21/zepto
    gocti       1E-24/yocto
</pre>

    <p>Large metric prefixes (greater than 1):</p>
<pre>
   dekto       10/deka 
    xecto       100/hecto
    kilto       1000/kilo   
    megdo       1E6/mega    
    gigdo       1E9/giga
    terto       1E12/tera
    petso       1E15/peta
    xexso       1E18/exa
    zetro       1E21/zetta
    gotro       1E24/yotta
</pre>

    <p>Other scientific or mathematical terms:</p>
<pre>
   delno       candela 
    kelvo       kelvin
    molro       mole
    radno       radian
    sinso       sine
    stero       steradian
    tanjo       tangent
    xampo       ampere
</pre>

    <p>The gismu ``sinso'' and ``tanjo'' were only made
    non-algorithmically because they were identical (having been
    borrowed from a common source) in all the dictionaries that had
    translations. The other terms in this group are units in the
    international metric system; some metric units, however, were
    made by the ordinary process (usually because they are
    different in Chinese).</p>

    <p>Finally, there are the cultural gismu, which are also
    borrowed, but by modifying a word from one particular language,
    instead of using the multi-lingual gismu creation algorithm.
    Cultural gismu are used for words that have local importance to
    a particular culture; other cultures or languages may have no
    word for the concept at all, or may borrow the word from its
    home culture, just as Lojban does. In such a case, the gismu
    algorithm, which uses weighted averages, doesn't accurately
    represent the frequency of usage of the individual concept.
    Cultural gismu are not even required to be based on the six
    major languages.</p>

    <p>The six Lojban source languages:</p>
<pre>
   jungo       Chinese (from ``Zhong<sup>1</sup> guo<sup>2</sup>'')
    glico       English
    xindo       Hindi
    spano       Spanish
    rusko       Russian
    xrabo       Arabic
</pre>

    <p>Seven other widely spoken languages that were on the list of
    candidates for gismu-making, but weren't used:</p>
<pre>
   bengo       Bengali
    porto       Portuguese
    baxso       Bahasa Melayu/Bahasa Indonesia
    ponjo       Japanese (from ``Nippon'')
    dotco       German (from ``Deutsch'')
    fraso       French (from ``Fran&ccedil;ais'')
    xurdo       Urdu
</pre>
    (Urdu and Hindi began as the same language with different
    writing systems, but have now become somewhat different
    principally in borrowed vocabulary. Urdu-speakers were counted
    along with Hindi-speakers when weights were assigned for
    gismu-making purposes.) 

    <p>Countries with a large number of speakers of any of the
    above languages (where the meaning of ``large'' is dependent on
    the specific language):</p>

    semto       Semitic
    slovo       Slavic
