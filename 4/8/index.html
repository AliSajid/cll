          <h3><a id="8" name="8">8. cmene</h3>

    <p>Lojbanized names, called ``cmene'', are very much like their
    counterparts in other languages. They are labels applied to
    things (or people) to stand for them in descriptions or in
    direct address. They may convey meaning in themselves, but do
    not necessarily do so.</p>

    <p>Because names are often highly personal and individual,
    Lojban attempts to allow native language names to be used with
    a minimum of modification. The requirement that the Lojban
    speech stream be unambiguously analyzable, however, means that
    most names must be modified somewhat when they are Lojbanized.
    Here are a few examples of English names and possible Lojban
    equivalents:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="8-1" name="8-1">8.1)</a>  djim.
    Jim
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="8-2" name="8-2">8.2)</a>  djein.
    Jane
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="8-3" name="8-3">8.3)</a>  .arnold.
    Arnold
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="8-4" name="8-4">8.4)</a>  pit.
    Pete
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="8-5" name="8-5">8.5)</a>  katrinas.
    Katrina
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="8-6" name="8-6">8.6)</a>  kat,r,in.
    Catherine
</pre>
    (Note that syllabic ``r'' is skipped in determining the
    stressed syllable, so <a href="#8-6">Example 8.6</a> is
    stressed on the ``ka''.) 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="8-7" name="8-7">8.7)</a>  katis.
    Cathy
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="8-8" name="8-8">8.8)</a>  keit.
    Kate
</pre>
    Names may have almost any form, but always end in a consonant,
    and are followed by a pause. They are penultimately stressed,
    unless unusual stress is marked with capitalization. A name may
    have multiple parts, each ending with a consonant and pause, or
    the parts may be combined into a single word with no pause. For
    example, 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="8-9" name="8-9">8.9)</a>  djan.  djonz.
</pre>
    and 
<pre>
<a id="8-10" name="8-10">8.10)</a>    djandjonz.
</pre>
    are both valid Lojbanizations of ``John Jones''. 

    <p>The final arbiter of the correct form of a name is the
    person doing the naming, although most cultures grant people
    the right to determine how they want their own name to be
    spelled and pronounced. The English name ``Mary'' can thus be
    Lojbanized as ``meris.'', ``maris.'', ``meiris.'', ``merix.'',
    or even ``marys.''. The last alternative is not pronounced much
    like its English equivalent, but may be desirable to someone
    who values spelling over pronunciation. The final consonant
    need not be an ``s''; there must, however, be some Lojban
    consonant at the end.</p>

    <p>Names are not permitted to have the sequences ``la'',
    ``lai'', or ``doi'' embedded in them, unless the sequence is
    immediately preceded by a consonant. These minor restrictions
    are due to the fact that all Lojban cmene embedded in a speech
    stream will be preceded by one of these words or by a pause.
    With one of these words embedded, the cmene might break up into
    valid Lojban words followed by a shorter cmene. However,
    break-up cannot happen after a consonant, because that would
    imply that the word before the ``la'', or whatever, ended in a
    consonant without pause, which is impossible.</p>

    <p>For example, the invalid name ``laplas.'' would look like
    the Lojban words ``la plas.'', and ``ilanas.'' would be
    misunderstood as ``.i la nas.''. However, ``nederlants.''
    cannot be misheard as ``neder lants.'', because ``neder'' with
    no following pause is not a possible Lojban word.</p>

    <p>There are close alternatives to these forbidden sequences
    that can be used in Lojbanizing names, such as ``ly'', ``lei'',
    and ``dai'' or ``do'i'', that do not cause these problems.</p>

    <p>Lojban cmene are identifiable as word forms by the following
    characteristics:</p>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dt>1)</dt>

      <dd>They must end in one or more consonants. There are no
      rules about how many consonants may appear in a cluster in
      cmene, provided that each consonant pair (whether standing by
      itself, or as part of a larger cluster) is a permissible
      pair.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>2)</dt>

      <dd>They may contain the letter y as a normal,
      non-hyphenating vowel. They are the only kind of Lojban word
      that may contain the two diphthongs ``iy'' and ``uy''.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>3)</dt>

      <dd>They are always followed in speech by a pause after the
      final consonant, written as ``.''.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>4)</dt>

      <dd>They may be stressed on any syllable; if this syllable is
      not the penultimate one, it must be capitalized when writing.
      Neither names nor words that begin sentences are capitalized
      in Lojban, so this is the only use of capital letters.</dd>
    </dl>
    Names meeting these criteria may be invented, Lojbanized from
    names in other languages, or formed by appending a consonant
    onto a cmavo, a gismu, a fu'ivla or a lujvo. Some cmene built
    from Lojban words are: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="8-11" name="8-11">8.11)</a>    pav.
    the One
    from the cmavo ``pa'', with rafsi ``pav'', meaning ``one''
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="8-12" name="8-12">8.12)</a>    sol.
    the Sun
    from the gismu ``solri'', meaning ``solar'', or actually
        ``pertaining to the Sun''
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="8-13" name="8-13">8.13)</a>    ralj.
    Chief (as a title)
    from the gismu ``ralju'', meaning ``principal''.
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="8-14" name="8-14">8.14)</a>    nol.
    Lord/Lady
    from the gismu ``nobli'', with rafsi ``nol'',
        meaning ``noble''.
</pre>
    To Lojbanize a name from the various natural languages, apply
    the following rules: 

    <dl>
      <dt>1)</dt>

      <dd>Eliminate double consonants and silent letters.</dd>

      <dt>2)</dt>

      <dd>Add a final ``s'' or ``n'' (or some other consonant that
      sounds good) if the name ends in a vowel.</dd>

      <dt>3)</dt>

      <dd>Convert all sounds to their closest Lojban
      equivalents.</dd>

      <dt>4)</dt>

      <dd>If possible and acceptable, shift the stress to the
      penultimate (next-to-the-last) syllable. Use commas and
      capitalization in written Lojban when it is necessary to
      preserve non-standard syllabication or stress. Do not
      capitalize names otherwise.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>5)</dt>

      <dd>If the name contains an impermissible consonant pair,
      insert a vowel between the consonants: ``y'' is
      recommended.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>6)</dt>

      <dd>No cmene may have the syllables ``la'', ``lai'', or
      ``doi'' in them, unless immediately preceded by a consonant.
      If these combinations are present, they must be converted to
      something else. Possible substitutions include ``ly'',
      ``ly'i'', and ``dai'' or ``do'i'', respectively.</dd>
    </dl>
    There are some additional rules for Lojbanizing the scientific
    names (technically known as ``Linnaean binomials'' after their
    inventor) which are internationally applied to each species of
    animal or plant. Where precision is essential, these names need
    not be Lojbanized, but can be directly inserted into Lojban
    text using the cmavo ``la'o'', explained in <a
    href="../../19/1/">Chapter 19</a>. Using this cmavo makes the
    already lengthy Latinized names at least four syllables longer,
    however, and leaves the pronunciation in doubt. The following
    suggestions, though incomplete, will assist in converting
    Linnaean binomals to valid Lojban names. They can also help to
    create fu'ivla based on Linnaean binomials or other words of
    the international scientific vocabulary. The term ``back
    vowel'' in the following list refers to any of the letters
    ``a'', ``o'', or ``u''; the term ``front vowel''
    correspondingly refers to any of the letters ``e'', ``i'', or
    ``y''. 

    <dl>
      <dt>1)</dt>

      <dd>Change double consonants other than ``cc'' to single
      consonants.</dd>

      <dt>2)</dt>

      <dd>Change ``cc'' before a front vowel to ``kc'', but
      otherwise to ``k''.</dd>

      <dt>3)</dt>

      <dd>Change ``c'' before a back vowel and final ``c'' to
      ``k''.</dd>

      <dt>4)</dt>

      <dd>Change ``ng'' before a consonant (other than ``h'') and
      final ``ng'' to ``n''.</dd>

      <dt>5)</dt>

      <dd>Change ``x'' to ``z'' initially, but otherwise to
      ``ks''.</dd>

      <dt>6)</dt>

      <dd>Change ``pn'' to ``n'' initially.</dd>

      <dt>7)</dt>

      <dd>Change final ``ie'' and ``ii'' to ``i''.</dd>

      <dt>8)</dt>

      <dd>Make the following idiosyncratic substitutions:</dd>

      <dt></dt>

      <dd>aa a ae e ch k ee i eigh ei ew u igh ai oo u ou u ow au
      ph f q k sc sk w u y i</dd>

      <dt></dt>

      <dd>However, the diphthong substitutions should not be done
      if the two vowels are in two different syllables.</dd>

      <dt>9)</dt>

      <dd>Change ``h'' between two vowels to ``''', but otherwise
      remove it completely. If preservation of the ``h'' seems
      essential, change it to ``x'' instead.</dd>

      <dt>10)</dt>

      <dd>Place ``''' between any remaining vowel pairs that do not
      form Lojban diphthongs.</dd>

      <dt></dt>

      <dd>Some further examples of Lojbanized names are:</dd>
