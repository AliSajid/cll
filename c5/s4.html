    <h3><a id="s4" name="s4">4. Complex tanru grouping</h3>

    <p>If one element of a tanru can be another tanru, why not both
    elements?</p>
<pre>
<a id="e4d1" name="e4d1">4.1)</a>  do mutce bo barda gerku bo kavbu
    You are-a-(very type-of large) (dog type-of capturer).
    You are a very large dog-catcher.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e4d1">Example 4.1</a>, the selbri is a tanru
    with seltau ``mutce bo barda'' and tertau ``gerku bo kavbu''.
    It is worth emphasizing once again that this tanru has the same
    fundamental ambiguity as all other Lojban tanru: the sense in
    which the ``dog type-of capturer'' is said to be ``very type-of
    large'' is not precisely specified. Presumably it is his body
    which is large, but theoretically it could be one of his other
    properties.</p>

    <p>We will now justify the title of this chapter by exploring
    the ramifications of the phrase ``pretty little girls'
    school'', an expansion of the tanru used in <a
    href="s3.html">Section 3</a> to four brivla. (Although this example
    has been used in the Loglan Project almost since the beginning
    --- it first appeared in Quine's book <cite>Word and
    Object</cite> (1960) --- it is actually a mediocre example
    because of the ambiguity of English ``pretty''; it can mean
    ``beautiful'', the sense intended here, or it can mean
    ``very''. Lojban ``melbi'' is not subject to this ambiguity: it
    means only ``beautiful''.) Here are four ways to group this
    phrase:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e4d2" name="e4d2">4.2)</a>  ta melbi cmalu
        nixli ckule
    That is-a-((pretty type-of little)
        type-of girl) type-of school.
    That is a school for girls who are beautifully small.

<a id="e4d3" name="e4d3">4.3)</a>   ta melbi cmalu nixli bo ckule
    That is-a-(pretty type-of little) (girl type-of school).
    That is a girls' school which is beautifully small.

<a id="e4d4" name="e4d4">4.4)</a>   ta melbi cmalu bo nixli
        ckule
    That is-a-(pretty type-of (little type-of girl))
        type-of school.
    That is a school for small girls who are beautiful.

<a id="e4d5" name="e4d5">4.5)</a>   ta melbi cmalu bo
        nixli bo ckule
    That is-a-pretty type-of (little type-of
        (girl type-of school)).
    That is a small school for girls which is beautiful.
</pre>
    <a href="#e4d5">Example 4.5</a> uses a construction which has
    not been seen before: ``cmalu bo nixli bo ckule'', with two
    consecutive uses of ``bo'' between brivla. The rule for
    multiple ``bo'' constructions is the opposite of the rule when
    no ``bo'' is present at all: the last two are grouped together.
    Not surprisingly, this is called the ``right-grouping rule'',
    and it is associated with every use of ``bo'' in the language.
    Therefore, 
<pre>
<a id="e4d6" name="e4d6">4.6)</a>  ta cmalu bo nixli bo ckule
    That is-a-little type-of (girl type-of school).
</pre>
    means the same as <a href="#e3d4">Example 3.4</a>, not <a
    href="#e3d5">Example 3.5</a>. This rule may seem peculiar at
    first, but one of its consequences is that ``bo'' is never
    necessary between the first two elements of any of the complex
    tanru presented so far: all of <a href="#e4d2">Examples
    4.2</a> through <a href="#e4d5">4.5</a> could have ``bo''
    inserted between ``melbi'' and ``cmalu'' with no change in
    meaning.
