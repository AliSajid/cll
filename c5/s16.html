          <h3><a id="s16" name="s16">16. ``Pretty little girls' school'': forty ways to say
    it</h3>

    <p>The following examples show every possible grouping
    arrangement of ``melbi cmalu nixli ckule'' using ``bo'' or ``ke
    ... ke'e'' for grouping and ``je'' or ``jebo'' for logical
    connection. Most of these are definitely not plausible
    interpretations of the English phrase ``pretty little girls'
    school'', especially those which describe something which is
    both a girl and a school.</p>

    <p>Examples 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, and 5.6 are repeated here as
    Examples 16.1, 16.9, 16.17, 16.25, and 16.33 respectively. The
    seven examples following each of these share the same grouping
    pattern, but differ in the presence or absence of ``je'' at
    each possible site. Some of the examples have more than one
    Lojban version. In that case, they differ only in grouping
    mechanism, and are always equivalent in meaning.</p>

    <p>The logical connective ``je'' is associative: that is, ``A
    and (B and C)'' is the same as ``(A and B) and C''. Therefore,
    some of the examples have the same meaning as others. In
    particular, 16.8, 16.16, 16.24, 16.32, and 16.40 all have the
    same meaning because all four brivla are logically connected
    and the grouping is simply irrelevant. Other equivalent forms
    are noted in the examples themselves. However, if ``je'' were
    replaced by ``naja'' or ``jo'' or most of the other logical
    connectives, the meanings would become distinct.</p>

    <p>It must be emphasized that, because of the ambiguity of all
    tanru, the English translations are by no means definitive ---
    they represent only one possible interpretation of the
    corresponding Lojban sentence.</p>
