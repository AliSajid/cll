    <h3><a id="s15" name="s15">15. Some types of symmetrical tanru</h3>

    <p>This section deals with symmetrical tanru, where order is
    not important. Many of these tanru can be expressed with a
    logical or non-logical connective between the components.</p>

    <p>The tanru may refer to things which are correctly specified
    by both tanru components. Some of these instances may also be
    seen as asymmetrical tanru where the seltau specifies a
    material. The connective ``je'' is appropriate:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>cipnrstrigi pacru'i</dt>

      <dd>owl demon (Skt) nolraitru prije royal sage (Skt) remna
      nakni human-being male (Qab = man) remna fetsi human-being
      female (Qab = woman) sonci tolvri soldier coward (Que) panzi
      nanmu offspring man (Ewe = son) panzi ninmu offspring woman
      (Ewe = daughter) solji sicni gold coin (Tur) solji junla gold
      watch (Tur,Kor,Hun) solji djine gold ring (Udm,Aba,Que) rokci
      zdani stone house (Imb) mudri zdani wooden house (Ewe) rokci
      bitmu stone wall (Ewe) solji carce gold chariot (Skt) mudri
      xarci wooden weapon (Skt) zdani tcadu home town (Chi)
      cipnrstrigi = fu'ivla for ``owl'' based on Linnean name
      pacru'i = evil-spirit tolvri = opposite-of-brave</dd>
    </dl>
    The tanru may refer to all things which are specified by either
    of the tanru components. The connective ``ja'' is appropriate: 

    <dl>
      <dt>nunji'a nunterji'a</dt>

      <dd>victory defeat (Skt = victory or defeat) donri nicte day
      night (Skt = day and night) lunra tarci moon stars (Skt =
      moon and stars) patfu mamta father mother (Imb,Kaz,Chi =
      parents) tuple birka leg arm (Kaz = extremity) nuncti
      nunpinxe eating drinking (Udm = cuisine) bersa tixnu son
      daughter (Chi = children) nunji'a = event-of-winning
      nunterji'a = event-of-losing nuncti = event-of-eating
      nunpinxe = event-of-drinking</dd>
    </dl>
    Alternatively, the tanru may refer to things which are
    specified by either of the tanru components or by some more
    inclusive class of things which the components typify: 

    <dl>
      <dt>curnu jalra</dt>

      <dd>worm beetle (Mon = insect) jalra curnu beetle worm (Mon =
      insect) kabri palta cup plate (Kaz = crockery) jipci gunse
      hen goose (Qab = housefowl) xrula tricu flower tree (Chi =
      vegetation)</dd>
    </dl>
    The tanru components specify crucial or typical parts of the
    referent of the tanru as a whole: 

    <dl>
      <dt>tumla vacri</dt>

      <dd>land air (Fin = world) moklu stedu mouth head (Aba =
      face) sudysrasu cunmi hay millet (Qab = agriculture) gugde
      ciste state system (Mon = politics) prenu so'imei people
      multitude (Mon = masses) djacu dertu water earth (Chi =
      climate) sudysrasu = dry-grass so'imei = manysome</dd>
    </dl>
