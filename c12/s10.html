    <h3><a id="s10" name="s10">10. Eliding SE rafsi from tertau</h3>

    <p>Eliding SE rafsi from tertau gets us into much more trouble.
    To understand why, recall that lujvo, following their veljvo,
    describe some type of whatever their tertau describe. Thus,
    ``posydji'' describes a type of ``djica'', ``gerzda'' describes
    a type of ``zdani'', and so on. What is certain is that
    ``gerzda'' does not describe a ``se zdani'' --- it is not a
    word that could be used to describe an inhabitant such as a
    dog.</p>

    <p>Now consider how we would translate the word ``blue-eyed''.
    Let's tentatively translate this word as ``blakanla'' (from
    ``blanu kanla'', meaning ``blue eye''). But immediately we are
    in trouble: we cannot say</p>
<pre>
<a id="e10d1" name="e10d1">10.1)</a>    la djak. cu blakanla
    Jack is-a-blue-eye
</pre>
    because Jack is not an eye, ``kanla'', but someone with an eye,
    ``se kanla''. At best we can say 
<pre>
<a id="e10d2" name="e10d2">10.2)</a>    la djak. cu se blakanla
    Jack is-the-bearer-of-blue-eyes
</pre>

    <p>But look now at the place structure of ``blakanla'': it is a
    symmetrical lujvo, so the place structure is:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e10d3"
name="e10d3">10.3)</a>    xe1=s1 is a blue eye of xe2=s2
</pre>

    <p>We end up being most interested in talking about the second
    place, not the first (we talk much more of people than of their
    eyes), so ``se'' would almost always be required.</p>

    <p>What is happening here is that we are translating the tertau
    wrongly, under the influence of English. The English suffix
    ``-eyed'' does not mean ``eye'', but someone with an eye, which
    is ``selkanla''.</p>

    <p>Because we've got the wrong tertau (eliding a ``se'' that
    really should be there), any attempt to accommodate the
    resulting lujvo into our guidelines for place structure is
    fitting a square peg in a round hole. Since they can be so
    misleading, lujvo with SE rafsi elided from the tertau should
    be avoided in favor of their more explicit counterparts: in
    this case, ``blaselkanla''.</p>
