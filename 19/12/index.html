          <h3>12. Parenthesis and metalinguistic commentary: TO, TOI,
    SEI</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   to  TO  open parenthesis
    to'i    TO  open editorial parenthesis
    toi TOI close parenthesis
    sei SEI metalinguistic bridi marker
</pre>
    The cmavo “to” and “toi” are discursive (non-mathematical)
    parentheses, for inserting parenthetical remarks. Any text
    whatsoever can go within the parentheses, and it is completely
    invisible to its context. It can, however, refer to the context
    by the use of pro-sumti and pro-bridi: any that have been
    assigned in the context are still assigned in the parenthetical
    remarks, but the reverse is not true. 
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">12.1)</a>     doi lisas. mi djica le nu
        to doi frank. ko sisti toi
        do viska le mlatu
    O Lisa, I desire the event-of
        ( O Frank, [imperative] stop! )
        you see the cat.
    Lisa, I want you to (Frank! Stop!) see the cat.
</pre>
    <a href="../12/#1">Example 12.1</a> implicitly redefines “do”
    within the parentheses: the listener is changed by “doi
    frank.” When the context sentence resumes, however, the old
    listener, Lisa, is automatically restored. 

    <p>There is another cmavo of selma'o TO: “to'i”. The
    difference between “to” and “to'i” is the difference
    between parentheses and square brackets in English prose.
    Remarks within “to ... toi” cmavo are implicitly by the same
    speaker, whereas remarks within “to'i ... toi” are implicitly
    by someone else, perhaps an editor:</p>
<pre>
<a id="12-2"
name="12-2">12.2)</a>    la frank. cusku lu mi prami do
        to'isa'a do du la djein. toi li'u
    Frank expresses “I love you
        [you = Jane]”
</pre>
    The “sa'a” suffix is a discursive cmavo (of selma'o UI)
    meaning “editorial insertion”, and indicating that the marked
    word or construct (in this case, the entire bracketed remark)
    is not part of the quotation. It is required whenever the
    “to'i ... toi” remark is physically within quotation marks,
    at least when speaking to literal-minded listeners; the
    convention may be relaxed if no actual confusion results. 

    <p>Note: The parser believes that parentheses are attached to
    the previous word or construct, because it treats them as
    syntactic equivalents of subscripts and other such so-called
    “free modifiers”. Semantically, however, parenthetical
    remarks are not necessarily attached either to what precedes
    them or what follows them.</p>

    <p>The cmavo “sei” (of selma'o SEI) begins an embedded
    discursive bridi. Comments added with “sei” are called
    “metalinguistic”, because they are comments about the
    discourse itself rather than about the subject matter of the
    discourse. This sense of the term “metalinguistic” is used
    throughout this chapter, and is not to be confused with the
    sense “language for expressing other languages”.</p>

    <p>When marked with “sei”, a metalinguistic utterance can be
    embedded in another utterance as a discursive. In this way,
    discursives which do not have cmavo assigned in selma'o UI can
    be expressed:</p>
<pre>
<a id="12-3"
name="12-3">12.3)</a>    la frank. prami sei la frank. gleki la djein.
    Frank loves (Frank is happy) Jane.
</pre>

    <p>Using the happiness attitudinal, “.ui”, would imply that
    the speaker was happy. Instead, the speaker attributes
    happiness to Frank. It would probably be safe to elide the one
    who is happy, and say:</p>
<pre>
<a id="12-4"
name="12-4">12.4)</a>    la frank. prami sei gleki la djein.
    Frank loves (he is happy) Jane.
</pre>

    <p>The grammar of the bridi following “sei” has an unusual
    limitation: the sumti must either all precede the selbri, or
    must be glued into the selbri with “be” and “bei”:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="12-5"
name="12-5">12.5)</a>    la frank. prami sei gleki be fa la suzn. la djein.
    Frank loves (Susan is happy) Jane.
</pre>

    <p>This restriction allows the terminator cmavo “se'u” to
    almost always be elided.</p>

    <p>Since a discursive utterance is working at a “higher”
    level of abstraction than a non-discursive utterance, a
    non-discursive utterance cannot refer to a discursive
    utterance. Specifically, the various back-counting, reciprocal,
    and reflexive constructs in selma'o KOhA ignore the utterances
    at “higher” metalinguistic levels in determining their
    referent. It is possible, and sometimes necessary, to refer to
    lower metalinguistic levels. For example, the English “he
    said” in a conversation is metalinguistic. For this purpose,
    quotations are considered to be at a lower metalinguistic level
    than the surrounding context (a quoted text cannot refer to the
    statements of the one who quotes it), whereas parenthetical
    remarks are considered to be at a higher level than the
    context.</p>

    <p>Lojban works differently from English in that the “he
    said” can be marked instead of the quotation. In Lojban, you
    can say:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="12-6"
name="12-6">12.6)</a>    la djan. cusku lu mi klama le zarci li'u
    John expresses “I go to-the store”.
</pre>
    which literally claims that John uttered the quoted text. If
    the central claim is that John made the utterance, as is likely
    in conversation, this style is the most sensible. However, in
    written text which quotes a conversation, you don't want the
    “he said” or “she said” to be considered part of the
    conversation. If unmarked, it could mess up the anaphora
    counting. Instead, you can use: 
<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">12.7)</a>    lu mi klama le zarci
        seisa'a la djan. cusku be dei li'u
    “ I go to-the store
        ( John expresses this-sentence ) ”
    “I go to the store”, said John.
</pre>

    <p>And of course other orders are possible:</p>
<pre>
<a id="12-8"
name="12-8">12.8)</a>    lu seisa'a la djan. cusku be dei mi klama le zarci
    John said, “I go to the store”.

<a id="12-9"
name="12-9">12.9)</a> lu mi klama seisa'a la djan cusku le zarci
    “I go”, John said, “to the store”.
</pre>

    <p>Note the “sa'a” following each “sei”, marking the
    “sei” and its attached bridi as an editorial insert, not part
    of the quotation. In a more relaxed style, these “sa'a” cmavo
    would probably be dropped.</p>

    <p>The elidable terminator for “sei” is “se'u” (of selma'o
    SEhU); it is rarely needed, except to separate a selbri within
    the “sei” comment from an immediately following selbri (or
    component) outside the comment.</p>
