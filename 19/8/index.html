          <h3>8. Attitude scope markers: FUhE/FUhO</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
     fu'e    FUhE    open attitudinal scope
     fu'o    FUhO    close attitudinal scope
</pre>
    Lojban has a complex system of “attitudinals”, words which
    indicate the speaker’s attitude to what is being said. The
    attitudinals include indicators of emotion, intensity markers,
    discursives (which show the structure of discourse), and
    evidentials (which indicate “how the speaker knows”). Most of
    these words belong to selma'o UI; the intensity markers belong
    to selma'o CAI for historical reasons, but the two selma'o are
    grammatically identical. The individual cmavo of UI and CAI are
    discussed in <a href="../../13/1/">Chapter 13</a>; only the
    rules for applying them in discourse are presented here. 

    <p>Normally, an attitudinal applies to the preceding word only.
    However, if the preceding word is a structural cmavo which
    begins or ends a whole construction, then that whole
    construction is affected by the attitudinal:</p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">8.1)</a>  mi viska le blanu .ia zdani [ku]
    I see the blue [belief] house.
    I see the house, which I believe to be blue.

<a id="2"
name="2">8.2)</a>   mi viska le blanu zdani .ia [ku]
    I see the blue house [belief].
    I see the blue thing, which I believe to be a house.

<a id="3"
name="3">8.3)</a>   mi viska le .ia blanu zdani [ku]
    I see the [belief] blue house
    I see what I believe to be a blue house.

<a id="4" name="4">8.4)</a>   mi viska le blanu zdani ku .ia
    I see (the blue house ) [belief]
    I see what I believe to be a blue house.
</pre>

    <p>An attitudinal meant to cover a whole sentence can be
    attached to the preceding “.i”, expressed or understood:</p>
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">8.5)</a>  [.i] .ia mi viska le blanu zdani
    [belief] I see the blue house
    I believe I see a blue house.
</pre>
    or to an explicit “vau” placed at the end of a bridi. 

    <p>Likewise, an attitudinal meant to cover a whole paragraph
    can be attached to “ni'o” or “no'i”. An attitudinal at the
    beginning of a text applies to the whole text.</p>

    <p>However, sometimes it is necessary to be more specific about
    the range of one or more attitudinals, particularly if the
    range crosses the boundaries of standard Lojban syntactic
    constructions. The cmavo “fu'e” (of selma'o FUhE) and
    “fu'o” (of selma'o FUhO) provide explicit scope markers.
    Placing “fu'e” in front of an attitudinal disconnects it from
    what precedes it, and instead says that it applies to all
    following words until further notice. The notice is given by
    “fu'o”, which can appear anywhere and cancels all in-force
    attitudinals. For example:</p>
<pre>
<a id="6"
name="6">8.6)</a>  mi viska le fu'e .ia blanu zdani fu'o ponse
    I see the [start] [belief] blue house [end] possessor
    I see the owner of what I believe to be a blue house.
</pre>

    <p>Here, only the “blanu zdani” portion of the three-part
    tanru “blanu zdani ponse” is marked as a belief of the
    speaker. Naturally, the attitudinal scope markers do not affect
    the rules for interpreting multi-part tanru: “blanu zdani”
    groups first because tanru group from left to right unless
    overridden with “ke” or “bo”.</p>

    <p>Other attitudinals of more local scope can appear after
    attitudinals marked by FUhE; these attitudinals are added to
    the globally active attitudinals rather than superseding
    them.</p>
