          <h3>14. Hesitation: Y</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo is discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   .y. Y   hesitation noise
</pre>
    Speakers often need to hesitate to think of what to say next or
    for some extra-linguistic reason. There are two ways to
    hesitate in Lojban: to pause between words (that is, to say
    nothing) or to use the cmavo “.y.” (of selma'o Y). This
    resembles in sound the English hesitation noise written “uh”
    (or “er”), but differs from it in the requirement for pauses
    before and after. Unlike a long pause, it cannot be mistaken
    for having nothing more to say: it holds the floor for the
    speaker. Since vowel length is not significant in Lojban, the
    “y” sound can be dragged out for as long as necessary.
    Furthermore, the sound can be repeated, provided the required
    pauses are respected. 

    <p>Since the hesitation sound in English is outside the formal
    language, English-speakers may question the need for a formal
    cmavo. Speakers of other languages, however, often hesitate by
    saying (or, if necessary, repeating) a word (“este” in some
    dialects of Spanish, roughly meaning “that is”), and Lojban's
    audio-visual isomorphism requires a written representation of
    all meaningful spoken behavior. Of course, “.y.” has no
    grammatical significance: it can appear anywhere at all in a
    Lojban sentence except in the middle of a word.</p>
