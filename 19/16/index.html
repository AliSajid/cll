          <h3>16. List of cmavo interactions</h3>

    <p>The following list gives the cmavo and selma’o that are
    recognized by the earliest stages of the parser, and specifies
    exactly which of them interact with which others. All of the
    cmavo are at least mentioned in this chapter. The cmavo are
    written in lower case, and the selma’o in UPPER CASE.</p>

    <p>“zo” quotes the following word, no matter what it is.</p>

    <p>“si” erases the preceding word unless it is a “zo”.</p>

    <p>“sa” erases the preceding word and other words, unless the
    preceding word is a “zo”.</p>

    <p>“su” is the same as “sa”, but erases more words.</p>

    <p>“lo’u” quotes all following words up to a “le’u” (but
    not a “zo le’u”).</p>

    <p>“le’u” is ungrammatical except at the end of a “lo’u
    quotation.</p>

    <p>ZOI cmavo use the following word as a delimiting word, no
    matter what it is, but using “le’u” may create
    difficulties.</p>

    <p>“zei” combines the preceding and the following word into a
    lujvo, but does not affect “zo”, “si”, “sa”, “su”,
    “lo’u”, ZOI cmavo, “fa’o”, and “zei”.</p>

    <p>BAhE cmavo mark the following word, unless it is “si”,
    “sa”, or “su”, or unless it is preceded by “zo”. Multiple
    BAhE cmavo may be used in succession.</p>

    <p>“bu” makes the preceding word into a lerfu word, except
    for “zo”, “si”, “sa”, “su”, “lo’u”, ZOI cmavo,
    “fa’o”, “zei”, BAhE cmavo, and “bu”. Multiple “bu”
    cmavo may be used in succession.</p>

    <p>UI and CAI cmavo mark the previous word, except for “zo”,
    “si”, “sa”, “su”, “lo’u”, ZOI, “fa’o”, “zei”, BAhE
    cmavo, and “bu”. Multiple UI cmavo may be used in succession.
    A following “nai” is made part of the UI.</p>

    <p>“.y.”, “da’o”, “fu’e”, and “fu’o” are the same as
    UI, but do not absorb a following “nai”.</p>
