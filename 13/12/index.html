          <h3>12. Discursives</h3>

    <p>The term ``discursive'' is used for those members of selma'o
    UI that provide structure to the discourse, and which show how
    a given word or utterance relates to the whole discourse. To
    express these concepts in regular bridi would involve extra
    layers of nesting: rather than asserting that ``I also came'',
    we would have to say ``I came; furthermore, the event of my
    coming is an additional instance of the relationship expressed
    by the previous sentence'', which is intolerably clumsy.
    Typical English equivalents of discursives are words or phrases
    like ``however'', ``summarizing'', ``in conclusion'', and ``for
    example''.</p>

    <p>Discursives are not attitudinals: they express no particular
    emotion. Rather, they are abbreviations for metalinguistic
    claims that reference the sentence or text they are found
    in.</p>

    <p>Discursives are most often used at the beginning of
    sentences, often attached to the ``.i'' that separates
    sentences in running discourse, but can (like all other
    indicators) be attached to single words when it seems necessary
    or useful.</p>

    <p>The discursives discussed in this section are given in
    groups, roughly organized by function. First, the ``consecutive
    discourse'' group:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
   ku'i    however/but/in contrast     [karbi]
    ji'a    additionally            [jmina]
    si'a    similarly           [simsa]
    mi'u    ditto               [mintu]
    po'o    the only relevant case
</pre>
    These five discursives are mutually exclusive, and therefore
    they are not usually considered as scales. The first four are
    used in consecutive discourse. The first, ``ku'i'', makes an
    exception to the previous argument. The second, ``ji'a'', adds
    weight to the previous argument. The third, ``si'a'', adds
    quantity to the previous argument, enumerating an additional
    example. The fourth, ``mi'u'', adds a parallel case to the
    previous argument, and can also be used in tables or the like
    to show that something is being repeated from the previous
    column. It is distinct from ``go'i'' (of selma'o GOhA,
    discussed in <a href="../../7/1/">Chapter 7</a>), which is a
    non-discursive version of ``ditto'' that explicitly repeats the
    claim of the previous bridi. 

    <p>Lastly, ``po'o'' is used when there is no other comparable
    case, and thus corresponds to some of the uses of ``only'', a
    word difficult to express in pure bridi form:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="12-1"
name="12-1">12.1)</a>    mi po'o darxi le mi tamne fo le nazbi
    I [only] hit my cousin at-locus the nose.
    Only I (nobody else) hit my cousin on his nose.

<a id="12-2"
name="12-2">12.2)</a> mi darxi po'o le mi tamne fo le nazbi
    I hit [only] my cousin at-locus the nose.
    I only hit my cousin on his nose
        (I did nothing else to him).

<a id="12-3"
name="12-3">12.3)</a> mi darxi le mi tamne po'o fo le nazbi
    I hit my cousin [only] at-locus the nose.
    I hit only my cousin on his nose (no one else).

<a id="12-4"
name="12-4">12.4)</a> mi darxi le mi tamne fo le nazbi po'o
    I hit my cousin at-locus the nose [only].
    I hit my cousin only on his nose (nowhere else).
</pre>
    Note that ``only'' can go before or after what it modifies in
    English, but ``po'o'', as an indicator, always comes afterward.
    

    <p>Next, the ``commentary on words'' group:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
   va'i    in other words      in the same words
            [valsi]
    ta'u    expanding a tanru   making a tanru
            [tanru]
</pre>
    The discursives ``va'i'' and ``ta'u'' operate at the level of
    words, rather than discourse proper, or if you like, they deal
    with how things are said. An alternative English expression for
    ``va'i'' is ``rephrasing''; for ``va'inai'', ``repeating''.
    Also compare ``va'i'' with ``ke'u'', discussed below. 

    <p>The cmavo ``ta'u'' is a discursive unique to Lojban; it
    expresses the particularly Lojbanic device of tanru. Since
    tanru are semantically ambiguous, they are subject to
    misunderstanding. This ambiguity can be removed by expanding
    the tanru into some semantically unambiguous structure, often
    involving relative clauses or the introduction of additional
    brivla. The discursive ``ta'u'' marks the transition from the
    use of a brief but possibly confusing tanru to its fuller,
    clearer expansion; the discursive ``ta'unai'' marks a
    transition in the reverse direction.</p>

    <p>Next, the ``commentary on discourse'' group:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
   li'a    clearly/obviously       obscurely
            [klina]
    ba'u    exaggeration    accuracy    understatement
            [banli]
    zo'o    humorously  dully       seriously

    sa'e    precisely speaking      loosely speaking
            [satci]
    to'u    in brief            in detail
            [tordu]
    do'a    generously          parsimoniously
            [dunda]
    sa'u    simply              elaborating
            [sampu]
    pa'e    justice             prejudice
            [pajni]
    je'u    truly               falsely
            [jetnu]
</pre>
    This group is used by the speaker to characterize the nature of
    the discourse, so as to prevent misunderstanding. It is
    well-known that listeners often fail to recognize a humorous
    statement and take it seriously, or miss an exaggeration, or
    try to read more into a statement than the speaker intends to
    put there. In speech, the tone of voice often provides the
    necessary cue, but the reader of ironic or understated or
    imprecise discourse is often simply clueless. As with the
    attitudinals, the use of these cmavo will seem fussy to new
    Lojbanists, but it is important to remember that ``zo'o'', for
    example, is the equivalent of smiling while you speak, not the
    equivalent of a flat declaration like ``What I'm about to say
    is supposed to be funny.'' 

    <p>A few additional English equivalents: for ``sa'enai'',
    ``roughly speaking'' or ``approximately speaking''; for
    ``sa'unai'', ``furthermore''; for ``to'u'', ``in short'' or
    ``skipping details''; for ``do'a'', ``broadly construed''; for
    ``do'anai'' (as you might expect), ``narrowly construed''.</p>

    <p>The cmavo ``pa'e'' is used to claim (truly or falsely) that
    one is being fair or just to all parties mentioned, whereas
    ``pa'enai'' admits (or proclaims) a bias in favor of one
    party.</p>

    <p>The scale of ``je'u'' and ``je'unai'' is a little different
    from the others in the group. By default, we assume that people
    speak the truth --- or at least, that if they are lying, they
    will do their best to conceal it from us. So under what
    circumstances would ``je'unai'' be used, or ``je'u'' be useful?
    For one thing, ``je'u'' can be used to mark a tautology: a
    sentence that is a truth of logic, like ``All cats are cats.''
    Its counterpart ``je'unai'' then serves to mark a logical
    contradiction. In addition, ``je'unai'' can be used to express
    one kind of sarcasm or irony, where the speaker pretends to
    believe what he/she says, but actually wishes the listener to
    infer a contrary opinion. Other forms of irony can be marked
    with ``zo'o'' (humor) or ``.ianai'' (disbelief).</p>

    <p>When used as a discursive, ``su'a'' (see <a
    href=../11/>Section 11</a>) belongs to this group.</p>

    <p>Next, the ``knowledge'' group:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
   ju'o    certainly   uncertain   certainly not
            [djuno]
    la'a    probably            improbably
            [lakne]
</pre>
    These two discursives describe the speaker's state of knowledge
    about the claim of the associated bridi. They are similar to
    the propositional attitudes of <a href=../3/>Section 3</a>, as
    they create a hypothetical world. We may be quite certain that
    something is true, and label our bridi with ``ju'o''; but it
    may be false all the same. 

    <p>Next, the ``discourse management'' group:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
   ta'o    by the way          returning to point
            [tanjo]
    ra'u    chiefly     equally     incidentally
            [ralju]
    mu'a    for example omitting ex.    end examples
            [mupli]
    zu'u    on the one hand         on the other hand

    ke'u    repeating           continuing
            [krefu]
    da'i    supposing           in fact
</pre>
    This final group is used to perform what may be called
    ``managing the discourse'': providing reference points to help
    the listener understand the flow from one sentence to the next.
    

    <p>Other English equivalents of ``ta'onai'' are ``anyway'',
    ``anyhow'', ``in any case'', ``in any event'', ``as I was
    saying'', and ``continuing''.</p>

    <p>The scale of ``ra'u'' has to do with the importance of the
    point being, or about to be, expressed: ``ra'u'' is the most
    important point, ``ra'ucu'i'' is a point of equal importance,
    and ``ra'unai'' is a lesser point. Other English equivalents of
    ``ra'u'' are ``above all'' and ``primarily''.</p>

    <p>The cmavo ``ke'u'' is very similar to ``va'i'', although
    ``ke'unai'' and ``va'inai'' are quite different. Both ``ke'u''
    and ``va'i'' indicate that the same idea is going to be
    expressed using different words, but the two cmavo differ in
    emphasis. Using ``ke'u'' emphasizes that the content is the
    same; using ``va'i'' emphasizes that the words are different.
    Therefore, ``ke'unai'' shows that the content is new (and
    therefore the words are also); ``va'inai'' shows that the words
    are the same (and therefore so is the content). One English
    equivalent of ``ke'unai'' is ``furthermore''.</p>

    <p>The discursive ``da'i'' marks the discourse as possibly
    taking a non-real-world viewpoint (``Supposing that'', ``By
    hypothesis''), whereas ``da'inai'' insists on the real-world
    point of view (``In fact'', ``In truth'', ``According to the
    facts''). A common use of ``da'i'' is to distinguish
    between:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="12-5"
name="12-5">12.5)</a>     ganai da'i do viska le mi citno mensi
        gi ju'o do djuno le du'u ri pazvau
    If you [hypothetical] see my young sister,
        then [certain] you know that she is-pregnant.
    If you were to see my younger sister,
        you would certainly know she is pregnant.
</pre>
    and: 
<pre>
<a id="12-6"
name="12-6">12.6)</a>     ganai da'inai do viska le mi citno mensi
        gi ju'o do djuno le du'u ri pazvau
    If you [factual] see my young sister,
        then [certainty] you know that she is-pregnant.
    If you saw my younger sister,
        you would certainly know she is pregnant.
</pre>

    <p>It is also perfectly correct to omit the discursive
    altogether, and leave the context to indicate which
    significance is meant. (Chinese always leaves this distinction
    to the context: the Chinese sentence</p>
<pre>
<a id="12-7"
name="12-7">12.7)</a>    ru<sup>2</sup>guo^3 ni^3 kan<sup>4</sup>dao^4 wo^3 mei<sup>4</sup>mei,
        ni^3 yi<sup>2</sup>ding^4 zhi<sup>1</sup>dao^4 ta^1 huai<sup>2</sup>yun^4 le
    if you see-arrive my younger-sister,
        you certainly know she pregnant
</pre>
    is the equivalent of either <a href="../12/#5">Example 12.5</a>
    or <a href="../12/#6">Example 12.6</a>.)
