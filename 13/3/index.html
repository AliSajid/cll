          <h3>3. Propositional attitude indicators</h3>

    <p>As mentioned at the beginning of <a href=../2/>Section
    2</a>, attitudinals may be divided into two groups, the pure
    emotion indicators explained in that section, and a contrasting
    group which may be called the “propositional attitude
    indicators”. These indicators establish an internal,
    hypothetical world which the speaker is reacting to, distinct
    from the world as it really is. Thus we may be expressing our
    attitude towards “what the world would be like if ...”, or
    more directly stating our attitude towards making the potential
    world a reality.</p>

    <p>In general, the bridi paraphrases of pure emotions look (in
    English) something like “I’m going to the market, and I’m
    happy about it”. The emotion is present with the subject of
    the primary claim, but is logically independent of it.
    Propositional attitudes, though, look more like “I intend to
    go to the market”, where the main claim is logically
    subordinate to the intention: I am not claiming that I am
    actually going to the market, but merely that I intend to.</p>

    <p>There is no sharp distinction between attitudinals beginning
    with “a” and those beginning with “e”; however, the
    original intent (not entirely realized due to the need to cram
    too many attitudes into too little space) was to make the
    members of the “a”-series the purer, more attitudinal
    realizers of a potential world, while the members of the
    “e”-series were more ambivalent or complex about the
    speaker’s intention with regard to the predication. The
    relationship between the “a”-series and the “e”-series is
    similar to that between the “u”-series and the “o”-series,
    respectively. A few propositional attitude indicators
    overflowed into the “i”-series as well.</p>

    <p>In fact, the entire distinction between pure emotions and
    propositional attitudes is itself a bit shaky: “.u'u” can be
    seen as a propositional attitude indicator meaning “I regret
    that ...”, and “a'e” (discussed below) can be seen as a pure
    emotion meaning “I’m awake/aware”. The division of the
    attitudinals into pure-emotion and propositional-attitude
    classes in this chapter is mostly by way of explanation; it is
    not intended to permit firm rulings on specific points.
    Attitudinals are the part of Lojban most distant from the
    “logical language” aspect.</p>

    <p>Here is the list of propositional attitude indicators
    grouped by initial letter, starting with those beginning with
    “a”:</p>
<pre>
   .a'a    attentive   inattentive avoiding
    .a'e    alertness           exhaustion
    .ai intent      indecision  refusal
    .a'i    effort      no real effort  repose
    .a'o    hope                despair
    .au desire      indifference    reluctance
    .a'u    interest    no interest repulsion
</pre>

    <p>Some examples (of a parental kind):</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">3.1)</a>  .a'a do zgana le veltivni
    [attentive] you observe the television-receiver.
    I’m noticing that you are watching the TV.
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">3.2)</a>  .a'enai do ranji bacru
    [exhaustion] you continuously utter.
    I’m worn out by your continuous talking.
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">3.3)</a>  .ai mi benji do le ckana
    [intent] I transfer you to-the bed.
    I’m putting you to bed.
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">3.4)</a>  .a'i mi ba gasnu
        le nu do cikna binxo
    [effort] I [future] am-the-actor-in
        the event-of you awake-ly become.
    It’ll be a real pain for me to wake you up.
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">3.5)</a>  .a'o mi kanryze'a
        ca le bavlamdei
    [hope] I am-health-increased at-time
        the future-adjacent-day.
    I hope I feel better tomorrow!
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">3.6)</a>  .au mi sipna
    [desire] I sleep.
    I want to sleep.
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">3.7)</a>  a'ucu'i do pante
    [no interest] you complain
    I have no interest in your complaints.
</pre>
    (In a real-life situation, Examples 3.1-3.7 would also be
    decorated by various pure emotion indicators, certainly
    including “.oicai”, but probably also “.iucai”.) 

    <p>Splitting off the attitude into an indicator allows the
    regular bridi grammar to do what it does best: express the
    relationships between concepts that are intended, desired,
    hoped for, or whatever. Rephrasing these examples to express
    the attitude as the main selbri would make for unacceptably
    heavyweight grammar.</p>

    <p>Here are the propositional attitude indicators beginning
    with “e”, which stand roughly in the relation to those
    beginning with “a” as the pure-emotion indicators beginning
    with “o” do to those beginning with “u” --- they are more
    complex or difficult:</p>
<pre>
   .e'a    permission          prohibition
    .e'e    competence          incompetence
    .ei obligation          freedom
    .e'i    constraint  independence    resistance to constraint
    .e'o    request             negative request
    .e'u    suggestion  no suggestion   warning
</pre>
    More examples (after a good night’s sleep): 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">3.8)</a>  .e'a do sazri le karce
    [permission] You drive the car.
    Sure, you can drive the car.
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="9" name="9">3.9)</a>  e'e mi lifri tu'a do
    [competence] I experience something-related-to you
    I feel up to dealing with you.
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="10" name="10">3.10)</a>    .ei mi tisna
        le karce ctilyvau
    [obligation] I fill
        the car-type-of petroleum-container.
    I should fill the car’s gas tank.
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="11" name="11">3.11)</a>    .e'o ko ko kurji
    [request] You-imperative of-you-imperative take-care.
    Please take care of yourself!
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="12" name="12">3.12)</a>    .e'u do klama le panka
    [suggestion] You go to-the park.
    I suggest going to the park.
</pre>

    <p>Finally, the propositional attitude indicators beginning
    with “i”, which are the overflow from the other sets:</p>
<pre>
   .ia belief      skepticism  disbelief
    .i'a    acceptance          blame
    .ie agreement           disagreement
    .i'e    approval    non-approval    disapproval
</pre>

    <p>Still more examples (much, much later):</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="3-13"
name="3-13">3.13)</a>    .ianai do pu pensi le nu tcica mi
    [disbelief] You [past] think the event-of deceiving me.
    I can’t believe you thought you could fool me.
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="3-14"
name="3-14">3.14)</a>    do .i'anai na xruti do le zdani
    You [blame] did-not return you to-the house
    I blame you for not coming home.
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="15" name="15">3.15)</a>    .ie mi na cusku
        lu'e le tcika
        be le nu xruti
    [agreement] I did-not express
        a-symbol-for the time-of-day
        of the event-of (you return)
    It’s true I didn’t tell you when to come back.
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="16" name="16">3.16)</a>    .i'enai do .i'e zukte
    [disapproval] you [approval] act
    I don’t approve of what you did, but I approve of you.
</pre>
    <a href="../3/#16">Example 3.16</a> illustrates the use of a
    propositional attitude indicator, “i'e”, in both the usual
    sense (at the beginning of the bridi) and as a pure emotion
    (attached to “do”). The event expressed by the main bridi is
    disapproved of by the speaker, but the referent of the sumti in
    the x1 place (namely the listener) is approved of. 

    <p>To indicate that an attitudinal discussed in this section is
    not meant to indicate a propositional attitude, the simplest
    expedient is to split the attitudinal off into a separate
    sentence. Thus, a version of <a href="../3/#8">Example 3.8</a>
    which actually claimed that the listener was or would be
    driving the car might be:</p>
<pre>
<a id="17" name="17">3.17)</a>    do sazri le karce .i e'a
    You drive the car.  [Permission].
    You’re driving (or will drive) the car,
        and that’s fine.
