          <h3><a id="s7" name="s7">7. Possessive sumti</h3>

    <p>In <a href="#e2d4">Examples 2.4</a> through <a
    href="#e2d6">2.6</a>, the sumti ``le mi karce'' appears,
    glossed as ``my car''. Although it might not seem so, this
    sumti actually contains a relative phrase. When a sumti appears
    between a descriptor and its description selbri, it is actually
    a ``pe'' relative phrase. So</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e7d1" name="e7d1">7.1)</a>  le mi karce cu xunre
    my car is-red.
</pre>
    and 
<pre>
<a id="e7d2" name="e7d2">7.2)</a>  le pe mi karce cu xunre
    the (associated-with me) car is-red.
</pre>
    mean exactly the same thing. Furthermore, since there are no
    special considerations of quantifiers here, 
<pre>
<a id="e7d3" name="e7d3">7.3)</a>  le karce pe mi cu xunre
    The car associated-with me is-red
</pre>
    means the same thing as well. A sumti like the one in <a
    href="#e7d1">Example 7.1</a> is called a ``possessive sumti''.
    Of course, it does not really indicate possession in the sense
    of ownership, but like ``pe'' relative phrases, indicates only
    weak association; you can say ``le mi karce'' even if you've
    only borrowed it for the night. (In English, ``my car'' usually
    means ``le karce po mi'', but we do not have the same sense of
    possession in ``my seat on the bus''; Lojban simply makes the
    weaker sense the standard one.) The inner sumti, ``mi'' in <a
    href="#e7d1">Example 7.1</a>, is correspondingly called the
    ``possessor sumti''. 

    <p>Historically, possessive sumti existed before any other kind
    of relative phrase or clause, and were retained when the
    machinery of relative phrases and clauses as detailed in this
    chapter so far was slowly built up. When preposed relative
    clauses of the <a href="#e7d2">Example 7.2</a> type were
    devised, possessive sumti were most easily viewed as a special
    case of them.</p>

    <p>Although any sumti, however complex, can appear in a
    full-fledged relative phrase, only simple sumti can appear as
    possessor sumti, without a ``pe''. Roughly speaking, the legal
    possessor sumti are: pro-sumti, quotations, names and
    descriptions, and numbers. In addition, the possessor sumti may
    not be preceded by a quantifier, as such a form would be
    interpreted as the unusual ``descriptor + quantifier + sumti''
    type of description. All these sumti forms are explained in
    full in <a href="../c6/s1.html">Chapter 6</a>.</p>

    <p>Here is an example of a description used in a possessive
    sumti:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e7d4" name="e7d4">7.4)</a>  le le nanmu ku karce cu blanu
    The (associated-with-the man) car is blue.
    The man's car is blue.


Note the explicit ``ku'' at the end of the possessor sumti,
which prevents the selbri of the possessor sumti from merging
with the selbri of the main description sumti.  Because of the
need for this ``ku'', the most common kind of possessor sumti
are pro-sumti, especially personal pro-sumti, which require no
elidable terminator.  Descriptions are more likely to be attached
with relative phrases.
</pre>

    <p>And here is a number used as a possessor sumti:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e7d5" name="e7d5">7.5)</a>  le li mu jdice se bende
    The of-the-number-five judging team-member
    Juror number 5
</pre>
    which is not quite the same as ``the fifth juror''; it simply
    indicates a weak association between the particular juror and
    the number 5. 

    <p>A possessive sumti may also have regular relative clauses
    attached to it. This would need no comment if it were not for
    the following special rule: a relative clause immediately
    following the possessor sumti is understood to affect the
    possessor sumti, not the possessive. For example:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e7d6" name="e7d6">7.6)</a>  le mi noi sipna vau karce
        cu na klama
    The of-me incidentally-which( is-sleeping ) car
        isn't going.
</pre>
    means that my car isn't going; the incidental claim of ``noi
    sipna'' applies to me, not my car, however. If I wanted to say
    that the car is sleeping (whatever that might mean) I would
    need: 
<pre>
<a id="e7d7" name="e7d7">7.7)</a>  le mi karce poi sipna cu na klama
    The of-me car which sleeps isn't going.
</pre>
    Note that <a href="#e7d6">Example 7.6</a> uses ``vau'' rather
    than ``ku'o'' at the end of the relative clause: this
    terminator ends every simple bridi and is almost always
    elidable; in this case, though, it is a syllable shorter than
    the equally valid alternative, ``ku'o''.
