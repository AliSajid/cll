    <h3><a id="s4" name="s4">4. Multiple relative clauses: ``zi'e''</h3>
<pre>
   zi'e    ZIhE        relative clause joiner
</pre>
    Sometimes it is necessary or useful to attach more than one
    relative clause to a sumti. This is made possible in Lojban by
    the cmavo ``zi'e'' (of selma'o ZIhE), which is used to join one
    or more relative clauses together into a single unit, thus
    making them apply to the same sumti. For example: 
<pre>
<a id="e4d1" name="e4d1">4.1)</a>  le gerku poi blabi zi'e poi batci le nanmu cu klama
    The dog which is white and which bites the man goes.
</pre>
    The most usual translation of ``zi'e'' in English is ``and'',
    but ``zi'e'' is not really a logical connective: unlike most of
    the true logical connectives (which are explained in <a
    href="../c14/s1.html">Chapter 14</a>), it cannot be converted into
    a logical connection between sentences. 

    <p>It is perfectly correct to use ``zi'e'' to connect relative
    clauses of different kinds:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e4d2" name="e4d2">4.2)</a>  le gerku poi blabi zi'e noi
        le mi pendo cu ponse ke'a cu klama
    The dog that-is( white) and incidentally-such-that(
        my friend owns IT) goes.
    The dog that is white, which my friend owns,
        is going.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e4d2">Example 4.2</a>, the restrictive clause
    ``poi blabi'' specifies which dog is referred to, but the
    incidental clause ``noi le mi pendo cu ponse'' is mere
    incidental information: the listener is supposed to already
    have identified the dog from the ``poi blabi''. Of course, the
    meaning (though not necessarily the emphasis) is the same if
    the incidental clause appears first.</p>

    <p>It is also possible to connect relative phrases with
    ``zi'e'', or a relative phrase with a relative clause:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e4d3" name="e4d3">4.3)</a>  le botpi po mi zi'e poi blanu cu spofu
    The bottle specific-to me and which-is blue is-broken.
    My blue bottle is broken.
</pre>

    <p>Note that if the colloquial translation of <a
    href="#e4d3">Example 4.3</a> were ``My bottle, which is blue,
    is broken'', then ``noi'' rather than ``poi'' would have been
    correct in the Lojban version, since that version of the
    English implies that you do not need to know the bottle is
    blue. As written, <a href="#e4d3">Example 4.3</a> suggests that
    I probably have more than one bottle, and the one in question
    needs to be picked out as the blue one.</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e4d4" name="e4d4">4.4)</a>  mi ba zutse le stizu pe mi
        zi'e po do zi'e poi xunre
    I [future] sit-in the chair associated-with me and
        specific-to you and which-is red.
    I will sit in my chair (really yours), the red one.
</pre>
    <a href="#e4d4">Example 4.4</a> illustrates that more than two
    relative phrases or clauses can be connected with ``zi'e''. It
    almost defies colloquial translation because of the very
    un-English contrast between ``pe mi'', implying that the chair
    is temporarily connected with me, and ``po do'', implying that
    the chair has a more permanent association with you. (Perhaps I
    am a guest in your house, in which case the chair would
    naturally be your property.) 

    <p>Here is another example, mixing a relative phrase and two
    relative clauses, a restrictive one and a non-restrictive
    one:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e4d5" name="e4d5">4.5)</a>  mi ba citka le dembi pe mi
        zi'e poi cpana le mi palta
        zi'e noi do dunda ke'a mi
    I [future] eat the beans associated-with me
        and which are-upon my plate
        and which-incidentally you gave IT to-me.
    I'll eat my beans that are on my plate, the ones
        you gave me.
</pre>
