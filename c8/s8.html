    <h3><a id="s8" name="s8">8. Relative clauses and complex sumti: ``vu'o''</h3>
<pre>
   vu'o    VUhO        relative clause attacher
</pre>

    <p>Normally, relative clauses attach only to simple sumti or
    parts of sumti: pro-sumti, names and descriptions, pure
    numbers, and quotations. An example of a relative clause
    attached to a pure number is:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e8d1" name="e8d1">8.1)</a>  li pai noi na'e
        frinu namcu
    The-number pi, incidentally-which
        is-a-non- fraction number
    The irrational number pi
</pre>
    And here is an incidental relative clause attached to a
    quotation: 
<pre>
<a id="e8d2" name="e8d2">8.2)</a>  lu mi klama le zarci li'u
        noi mi cusku ke'a cu jufra
    [quote] I go to-the market [unquote]
        incidentally-which( I express IT) is-a-sentence.
    ``I'm going to the market'', which I'd said, is a sentence.
</pre>
    which may serve to identify the author of the quotation or some
    other relevant, but subsidiary, fact about it. All such
    relative clauses appear only after the simple sumti, never
    before it. 

    <p>In addition, sumti with attached sumti qualifiers of selma'o
    LAhE or NAhE+BO (which are explained in detail in <a
    href="../c6/s1.html">Chapter 6</a>) can have a relative clause
    appearing after the qualifier and before the qualified sumti,
    as in:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e8d3" name="e8d3">8.3)</a>  la'e poi tolcitno vau
        lu le xunre cmaxirma li'u
        cu zvati le vu kumfa
    A-referent-of (which is-old)
        [quote] The Red Small-horse [unquote]
        is-at the [far distance] room.
    An old ``The Red Pony'' is in the far room.
</pre>
    <a href="#e8d3">Example 8.3</a> is a bit complex, and may need
    some picking apart. The quotation ``lu le xunre cmaxirma li'u''
    means the string of words ``The Red Pony''. If the ``la'e'' at
    the beginning of the sentence were omitted, <a
    href="#e8d3">Example 8.3</a> would claim that a certain string
    of words is in a room distant from the speaker. But obviously a
    string of words can't be in a room! The effect of the ``la'e''
    is to modify the sumti so that it refers not to the words
    themselves, but to the referent of those words, a novel by John
    Steinbeck (presumably in Lojban translation). The particular
    copy of ``The Red Pony'' is identified by the restrictive
    relative clause. <a href="#e8d3">Example 8.3</a> means exactly
    the same as: 
<pre>
<a id="e8d4" name="e8d4">8.4)</a>  la'e lu le xunre cmaxirma li'u lu'u
        poi to'ercitno cu zvati le vu kumfa
    A-referent-of ([quote] The Red Small-horse [unquote])
        which is-old is-at the [far distance] room.
</pre>
    and the two sentences can be considered stylistic variants.
    Note the required ``lu'u'' terminator, which prevents the
    relative clause from attaching to the quotation itself: we do
    not wish to refer to an old quotation! 

    <p>Sometimes, however, it is important to make a relative
    clause apply to the whole of a more complex sumti, one which
    involves logical or non-logical connection (explained in <a
    href="../c14/s1.html">Chapter 14</a>). For example,</p>
<pre>
<a id="e8d5" name="e8d5">8.5)</a>  la frank. .e la djordj. noi nanmu
        cu klama le zdani
    Frank and George incidentally-who is-a-man
        go to-the house.
    Frank and George, who is a man, go to the house.
</pre>

    <p>The incidental claim in <a href="#e8d5">Example 8.5</a> is
    not that Frank and George are men, but only that George is a
    man, because the incidental relative clause attaches only to
    ``la djordj'', the immediately preceding simple sumti.</p>

    <p>To make a relative clause attach to both parts of the
    logically connected sumti in <a href="#e8d5">Example 8.5</a>, a
    new cmavo is needed, ``vu'o'' (of selma'o VUhO). It is placed
    between the sumti and the relative clause, and extends the
    sphere of influence of that relative clause to the entire
    preceding sumti, including however many logical or non-logical
    connectives there may be.</p>
<pre>
<a id="e8d6" name="e8d6">8.6)</a>  la frank. .e la djordj. vu'o noi nanmu
        cu klama le zdani
    Frank and George incidentally-who are-men
        go to-the house.
    Frank and George, who are men, go to the house.
</pre>

    <p>The presence of ``vu'o'' here means that the relative clause
    ``noi nanmu'' extends to the entire logically connected sumti
    ``la frank. .e la djordj.''; in other words, both Frank and
    George are claimed to be men, as the colloquial translation
    shows.</p>

    <p>English is able to resolve the distinction correctly in the
    case of <a href="#e8d5">Example 8.5</a> and <a
    href="#e8d6">Example 8.6</a> by making use of number: ``who
    is'' rather than ``who are''. Lojban doesn't distinguish
    between singular and plural verbs: ``nanmu'' can mean ``is a
    man'' or ``are men'', so another means is required.
    Furthermore, Lojban's mechanism works correctly in general: if
    ``nanmu'' (meaning ``is-a-man'') were replaced with ``pu
    bajra'' (``ran''), English would have to make the distinction
    some other way:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e8d7" name="e8d7">8.7)</a>  la frank. .e la djordj. noi pu bajra
        cu klama le zdani
    Frank and (George who [past] runs)
        go to-the house.
    Frank and George, who ran, go to the house.

<a id="e8d8" name="e8d8">8.8)</a>   la frank. .e la djordj. vu'o noi pu bajra
        cu klama le zdani
    (Frank and George) who [past] runs
        go to-the house.
    Frank and George, who ran, go to the house.
</pre>

    <p>In spoken English, tone of voice would serve; in written
    English, one or both sentences would need rewriting.</p>
