    <h3><a id="s9" name="s9">9. Relative clauses in vocative phrases</h3>

    <p>Vocative phrases are explained in more detail in <a
    href="../c6/s1.html">Chapter 6</a>. Briefly, they are a method of
    indicating who a sentence or discourse is addressed to: of
    identifying the intended listener. They take three general
    forms, all beginning with cmavo from selma'o COI or DOI (called
    ``vocative words''; there can be one or many), followed by
    either a name, a selbri, or a sumti. Here are three
    examples:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e9d1" name="e9d1">9.1)</a>  coi. frank.
    Hello, Frank.

<a id="e9d2" name="e9d2">9.2)</a>   co'o xirma
    Goodbye, horse.

<a id="e9d3" name="e9d3">9.3)</a>   fi'i la frank. .e la djordj.
    Welcome, Frank and George!
</pre>

    <p>Note that <a href="#e9d2">Example 9.2</a> says farewell to
    something which doesn't really have to be a horse, something
    that the speaker simply thinks of as being a horse, or even
    might be something (a person, for example) who is named
    ``Horse''. In a sense, <a href="#e9d2">Example 9.2</a> is
    ambiguous between ``co'o le xirma'' and ``co'o la xirma'', a
    relatively safe semantic ambiguity, since names are ambiguous
    in general: saying ``George'' doesn't distinguish between the
    possible Georges.</p>

    <p>Similarly, <a href="#e9d1">Example 9.1</a> can be thought of
    as an abbreviation of:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e9d4" name="e9d4">9.4)</a>  coi la frank.
    Hello, the-one-named ``Frank''.
</pre>

    <p>Syntactically, vocative phrases are a kind of free modifier,
    and can appear in many places in Lojban text, generally at the
    beginning or end of some complete construct; or, as in <a
    href="#e9d1">Examples 9.1</a> to <a href="#e9d3">9.3</a>, as
    sentences by themselves.</p>

    <p>As can be seen, the form of vocative phrases is similar to
    that of sumti, and as you might expect, vocative phrases allow
    relative clauses in various places. In vocative phrases which
    are simple names (after the vocative words), any relative
    clauses must come just after the names:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e9d5" name="e9d5">9.5)</a>  coi. frank. poi xunre se bende
    Hello, Frank who is-a-red team-member
    Hello, Frank from the Red Team!
</pre>

    <p>The restrictive relative clause in <a href="#e9d5">Example
    9.5</a> suggests that there is some other Frank (perhaps on the
    Green Team) from whom this Frank, the one the speaker is
    greeting, must be distinguished.</p>

    <p>A vocative phrase containing a selbri can have relative
    clauses either before or after the selbri; both forms have the
    same meaning. Here are some examples:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e9d6" name="e9d6">9.6)</a>  co'o poi mi zvati ke'a ku'o xirma
    Goodbye, such-that( I am-at IT ) horse
    Goodbye, horse where I am!

<a id="e9d7" name="e9d7">9.7)</a>   co'o xirma poi mi zvati
    Goodbye, horse such-that( I am-at-it).
</pre>
    <a href="#e9d6">Example 9.6</a> and <a href="#e9d7">Example
    9.7</a> mean the same thing. In fact, relative clauses can
    appear in both places.
