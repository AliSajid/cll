  <h3><a id="s11" name="s11">11. Examples of brivla</h3>

  <p>The simplest form of selbri is an individual word. A word
  which may by itself express a selbri relation is called a
  ``brivla''. The three types of brivla are gismu (root words),
  lujvo (compounds), and fu'ivla (borrowings from other languages).
  All have identical grammatical uses. So far, most of our selbri
  have been gismu or tanru built from gismu.</p>

  <p>gismu:</p>

<pre>
<a id="e11d1" name="e11d1">11.1)</a>    mi   [cu] klama ti         
zo'e   zo'e  ta
    --        ===== --          ----   ----  --
    Go-er     goes  destination origin route means.
    I go here (to this) using that means
        (from somewhere via some route).
</pre>

  lujvo: 
<pre>
<a id="e11d2" name="e11d2">11.2)</a>    ta  [cu] blari'o
    --       =======
    That    is-blue-green.

  fu'ivla:

    --       ===========
    This     is-spaghetti.
</pre>

  Some cmavo may also serve as selbri, acting as variables that
  stand for another selbri. The most commonly used of these is
  ``go'i'', which represents the main bridi of the previous Lojban
  sentence, with any new sumti or other sentence features being
  expressed replacing the previously expressed ones. Thus, in this
  context:
