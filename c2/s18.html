        <h3><a id="s18" name="s18">18. Lojban grammatical terms</h3>

  <p>Here is a review of the Lojban grammatical terms used in this
  chapter, plus some others used throughout this book. Only terms
  that are themselves Lojban words are included: there are of
  course many expressions like ``indicator'' in 
  <a href="../c16/s1.html">Chapter 16</a>

  that are not explained here. See the Index for further help with
  these.</p>

  <p>

    <dt>brivla:</dt>

    <dd>one of the Lojban parts of speech; a content word; a

    <dd>a compound word; a kind of brivla; may or may not appear in
    a dictionary; does not have associated rafsi. See

    .</dd>
  

  
    <dt>tanru:</dt>

    .</dd>
 

  
    <dt>selma'o:</dt>

    <dd>a group of cmavo that have the same grammatical use (can
