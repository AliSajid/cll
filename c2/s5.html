  <h3><a id="s5" name="s5">5. Some simple Lojban bridi</h3>

  <p>Let's look at a simple Lojban bridi. The place structure of
  the gismu ``tavla'' is</p>

<pre>
<a id="e5d1" name="e5d1">5.1)</a>  x1 talks to x2 about x3 in language
x4
</pre>

  where the ``x''es with following numbers represent the various
  arguments that could be inserted at the given positions in the
  English sentence. For example: 
  <p>
  </p>

<pre>
<a id="e5d2" name="e5d2">5.2)</a>  John talks to Sam about engineering
in Lojban.
</pre>

  has ``John'' in the x1 place, ``Sam'' in the x2 place,
  ``engineering'' in the x3 place, and ``Lojban'' in the x4 place,
  and could be paraphrased: 
<pre>
<a id="e5d3" name="e5d3">5.3)</a>  Talking is going on,
        with speaker John
        and listener Sam
        and subject matter engineering
        and language Lojban.
</pre>

  <p>The Lojban bridi corresponding to 
  <a href="#e5d1">Example 5.1</a>

  will have the form</p>

  <p>
  </p>

<pre>
<a id="e5d4" name="e5d4">5.4)</a>  x1 [cu] tavla x2 x3 x4
    --      ===== -- -- --
</pre>

  The word ``cu'' serves as a separator between any preceding sumti
  and the selbri. It can often be omitted, as in the following
  examples. 
<pre>
<a id="e5d5" name="e5d5">5.5)</a>  mi tavla do zo'e zo'e
    -- ===== -- ---- ----
    I talk to you about something in some language.

<a id="e5d6" name="e5d6">5.6)</a>   do tavla mi ta zo'e
    -- ===== -- -- ----
    You talk to me about that thing in a language.

<a id="e5d7" name="e5d7">5.7)</a>   mi tavla zo'e tu ti
    -- ===== ---- -- --
    I talk to someone about that thing yonder
        in this language.
</pre>

  (
  <a href="#e5d7">Example 5.7</a>

  is a bit unusual, as there is no easy way to point to a language;
  one might point to a copy of this book, and hope the meaning gets
  across!) 
  <p>When there are one or more occurrences of the cmavo ``zo'e''
  at the end of a bridi, they may be omitted, a process called
  ``ellipsis''. 
  <a href="#e5d5">Example 5.5</a>

  and 
  <a href="#e5d6">Example 5.6</a>

  may be expressed thus:</p>

<pre>
<a id="e5d8" name="e5d8">5.8)</a>  mi tavla do
    -- ===== --
    I talk to you (about something in some language).

<a id="e5d9" name="e5d9">5.9)</a>   do tavla mi ta
    -- ===== -- --
    You talk to me about that thing (in some language).
</pre>

  <p>Note that 
  <a href="#e5d7">Example 5.7</a>

  is not subject to ellipsis by this direct method, as the ``zo'e''
  in it is not at the end of the bridi.</p>
