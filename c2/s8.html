  <h3><a id="s8" name="s8">8. The basic structure of longer utterances</h3>

  <p>People don't always say just one sentence. Lojban has a
  specific structure for talk or writing that is longer than one
  sentence. The entirety of a given speech event or written text is
  called an utterance. The sentences (usually, but not always,
  bridi) in an utterance are separated by the cmavo ``ni'o'' and
  ``.i''. These correspond to a brief pause (or nothing at all) in
  spoken English, and the various punctuation marks like period,
  question mark, and exclamation mark in written English. These
  separators prevent the sumti at the beginning of the next
  sentence from being mistaken for a trailing sumti of the previous
  sentence.</p>

  <p>The cmavo ``ni'o'' separates paragraphs (covering different
  topics of discussion). In a long text or utterance, the topical
  structure of the text may be indicated by multiple ``ni'o''s,
  with perhaps ``ni'oni'oni'o'' used to indicate a chapter,
  ``ni'oni'o'' to indicate a section, and a single ``ni'o'' to
  indicate a subtopic corresponding to a single English
  paragraph.</p>

  <p>The cmavo ``.i'' separates sentences. It is sometimes
  compounded with words that modify the exact meaning (the
  semantics) of the sentence in the context of the utterance. (The
  cmavo ``xu'', discussed in 
  <a href="s1.html">Section 1</a>

  .7, is one such word --- it turns the sentence from a statement
  to a question about truth.) When more than one person is talking,
  a new speaker will usually omit the ``.i'' even though she/he may
  be continuing on the same topic.</p>

  <p>It is still O.K. for a new speaker to say the ``.i'' before
  continuing; indeed, it is encouraged for maximum clarity (since
  it is possible that the second speaker might merely be adding
  words onto the end of the first speaker's sentence). A good
  translation for ``.i'' is the ``and'' used in run-on sentences
  when people are talking informally: ``I did this, and then I did
  that, and ..., and ...''.</p>
