        <h3><a id="s1" name="s1">1. The concept of the bridi</h3>

  <p>This chapter gives diagrammed examples of basic Lojban
  sentence structures. The most general pattern is covered first,
  followed by successive variations on the basic components of the
  Lojban sentence. There are many more capabilities not covered in
  this chapter, but covered in detail in later chapters, so this
  chapter is a ``quick tour'' of the material later covered more
  slowly throughout the book. It also introduces most of the Lojban
  words used to discuss Lojban grammar.</p>

  <p>Let us consider John and Sam and three statements about
  them:</p>

<pre>
<a id="e1d1" name="e1d1">1.1)</a>  John is the father of Sam.

<a id="e1d2" name="e1d2">1.2)</a>   John hits Sam.

<a id="e1d3" name="e1d3">1.3)</a>   John is taller than Sam.
</pre>

  These examples all describe relationships between John and Sam.
  However, in English, we use the noun ``father'' to describe a
  static relationship in 
  <a href="#e1d1">Example 1.1</a>

  , the verb ``hits'' to describe an active relationship in 
  <a href="#e1d2">Example 1.2</a>

  , and the adjective ``taller'' to describe an attributive
  relationship in 
  <a href="#e1d3">Example 1.3</a>

  . In Lojban we make no such grammatical distinctions; these three
  sentences, when expressed in Lojban, are structurally identical.
  The same part of speech is used to represent the relationship. In
  formal logic this whole structure is called a ``predication''; in
  Lojban it is called a ``bridi'', and the central part of speech
  is the ``selbri''. Logicians refer to the things thus related as
  arguments, while Lojbanists call them ``sumti''. These Lojban
  terms will be used for the rest of the book. 
<pre>
         bridi (predicate)
    ______________|________________
    |                              |
    John     is the father of       Sam
    |____|   |______________|      |___|
       |              |              |
    sumti      selbri          sumti (argument)
</pre>

  In a relationship, there are a definite number of things being
  related. In English, for example, ``give'' has three places: the
  donor, the recipient and the gift. For example: 
<pre>
<a id="e1d4" name="e1d4">1.4)</a>  John gives Sam the book.
</pre>

  and 

<pre>
<a id="e1d5" name="e1d5">1.5)</a>  Sam gives John the book.
</pre>

  mean two different things because the relative positions of
  ``John'' and ``Sam'' have been switched. 
  <p>Further,</p>

<pre>
<a id="e1d6" name="e1d6">1.6)</a>  The book gives John Sam.
</pre>

  seems strange to us merely because the places are being filled by
  unorthodox arguments. The relationship expressed by ``give'' has
  not changed. 

  <p>In Lojban, each selbri has a specified number and type of
  arguments, known collectively as its ``place structure''. The
  simplest kind of selbri consists of a single root word, called a
  ``gismu'', and the definition in a dictionary gives the place
  structure explicitly. The primary task of constructing a Lojban
  sentence, after choosing the relationship itself, is deciding
  what you will use to fill in the sumti places.</p>

  <p>This book uses the Lojban terms ``bridi'', ``sumti'', and
  ``selbri'', because it is best to come to understand them
  independently of the English associations of the corresponding
  words, which are only roughly similar in meaning anyhow.</p>

  <p>The Lojban examples in this chapter (but not in the rest of
  the book) use a single underline (---) under each sumti, and a
  double underline (===) under each selbri, to help you to tell
  them apart.</p>
