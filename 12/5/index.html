          <h3>5. Symmetrical and asymmetrical lujvo</h3>

    <p>A common pattern, perhaps the most common pattern, of
    lujvo-making creates what is called a “symmetrical lujvo”. A
    symmetrical lujvo is one based on a tanru interpretation such
    that the first place of the seltau is equivalent to the first
    place of the tertau: each component of the tanru characterizes
    the same object. As an illustration of this, consider the lujvo
    “balsoi”: it is intended to mean “both great and a soldier”
    --- that is, “great soldier”, which is the interpretation we
    would tend to give its veljvo, “banli sonci”. The underlying
    gismu place structures are:</p>
<pre>
<a id="5-1"
name="5-1">5.1)</a>  “banli”: b1 is great in property b2 by standard b3
    “sonci”: s1 is a soldier of army s2
</pre>

    <p>In this case the s1 place of “sonci” is redundant, since
    it is equivalent to the b1 place of “banli”. Therefore the
    place structure of “balsoi” need not include places for both
    s1 and b1, as they refer to the same thing. So the place
    structure of “balsoi” is at most</p>
<pre>
<a id="5-2"
name="5-2">5.2)</a>  b1=s1 is a great soldier of army s2
        in property b2 by standard b3
</pre>
    Some symmetrical veljvo have further equivalent places in
    addition to the respective first places. Consider the lujvo
    “tinju'i”, “to listen” (“to hear attentively, to hear and
    pay attention”). The place structures of the gismu “tirna”
    and “jundi” are: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="5-3"
name="5-3">5.3)</a>  “tirna”: t1 listens to t2 against background noise t3
    “jundi”: j1 pays attention to j2
</pre>
    and the place structure of the lujvo is: 
<pre>
<a id="5-4"
name="5-4">5.4)</a>  j1=t1 listens to j2=t2 against background noise t3
</pre>

    <p>Why so? Because not only is the j1 place (the one who pays
    attention) equivalent to the t1 place (the hearer), but the j2
    place (the thing paid attention to) is equivalent to the t2
    place (the thing heard).</p>

    <p>A substantial minority of lujvo have the property that the
    first place of the seltau (“gerku” in this case) is
    equivalent to a place other than the first place of the tertau;
    such lujvo are said to be “asymmetrical”. (There is a
    deliberate parallel here with the terms “asymmetrical tanru”
    and “symmetrical tanru” used in <a href="../../5/1/">Chapter
    5</a>.)</p>

    <p>In principle any asymmetrical lujvo could be expressed as a
    symmetrical lujvo. Consider “gerzda”, discussed in <a
    href=../3/>Section 3</a>, where we learned that the g1 place
    was equivalent to the z2 place. In order to get the places
    aligned, we could convert “zdani” to “se zdani” (or
    “selzda” when expressed as a lujvo). The place structure of
    “selzda” is</p>
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">5.5)</a>  s1 is housed by nest s2
</pre>
    and so the three-part lujvo “gerselzda” would have the place
    structure 
<pre>
<a id="5-6"
name="5-6">5.6)</a>  s1=g1 is a dog housed in nest s2 of dog breed g2
</pre>

    <p>However, although “gerselzda” is a valid lujvo, it doesn't
    translate “doghouse”; its first place is the dog, not the
    doghouse. Furthermore, it is more complicated than necessary;
    “gerzda” is simpler than “gerselzda”.</p>

    <p>From the reader's or listener's point of view, it may not
    always be obvious whether a newly met lujvo is symmetrical or
    asymmetrical, and if the latter, what kind of asymmetrical
    lujvo. If the place structure of the lujvo isn't given in a
    dictionary or elsewhere, then plausibility must be applied,
    just as in interpreting tanru.</p>

    <p>The lujvo “karcykla”, for example, is based on “karce
    klama”, or “car goer”. The place structure of “karce”
    is:</p>
<pre>
<a id="5-7"
name="5-7">5.7)</a>  ka1 is a car carrying ka2 propelled by ka3
</pre>

    <p>A asymmetrical interpretation of “karcykla” that is
    strictly analogous to the place structure of “gerzda”,
    equating the kl2 (destination) and ka1 (car) places, would lead
    to the place structure</p>
<pre>
<a id="5-8"
name="5-8">5.8)</a>  kl1 goes to car kl2=ka1 which carries ka2
        propelled by ka3 from origin kl3
        via route kl4 by means of kl5
</pre>

    <p>But in general we go about in cars, rather than going to
    cars, so a far more likely place structure treats the ka1 place
    as equivalent to the kl5 place, leading to</p>
<pre>
<a id="5-9"
name="5-9">5.9)</a>  kl1 goes to destination kl2 from origin kl3
        via route kl4 by means of car kl5=ka1
        carrying ka2 propelled by ka3.
</pre>
    instead.
