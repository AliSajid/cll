          <h3>7. Ordering lujvo places.</h3>

    <p>So far, we have concentrated on selecting the places to go
    into the place structure of a lujvo. However, this is only half
    the story. In using selbri in Lojban, it is important to
    remember the right order of the sumti. With lujvo, the need to
    attend to the order of sumti becomes critical: the set of
    places selected should be ordered in such a way that a reader
    unfamiliar with the lujvo should be able to tell which place is
    which.</p>

    <p>If we aim to make understandable lujvo, then, we should make
    the order of places in the place structure follow some
    conventions. If this does not occur, very real ambiguities can
    turn up. Take for example the lujvo “jdaselsku”, meaning
    “prayer”. In the sentence</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">7.1)</a>  di’e jdaselsku la dong.
    This-utterance is-a-prayer somehow-related-to-Dong.
</pre>
    we must be able to know if Dong is the person making the
    prayer, giving the meaning 
<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">7.2)</a>  This is a prayer by Dong
</pre>
    or is the entity being prayed to, resulting in 
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">7.3)</a>  This is a prayer to Dong
</pre>

    <p>We could resolve such problems on a case-by-case basis for
    each lujvo (<a href=../14/>Section 14</a> discusses when this
    is actually necessary), but case-by-case resolution for
    run-of-the-mill lujvo makes the task of learning lujvo place
    structures unmanageable. People need consistent patterns to
    make sense of what they learn. Such patterns can be found
    across gismu place structures (see <a href=../16/>Section
    16</a>), and are even more necessary in lujvo place structures.
    Case-by-case consideration is still necessary; lujvo creation
    is a subtle art, after all. But it is helpful to take advantage
    of any available regularities.</p>

    <p>We use two different ordering rules: one for symmetrical
    lujvo and one for asymmetrical ones. A symmetrical lujvo like
    “balsoi” (from <a href=../5/>Section 5</a>) has the places of
    its tertau followed by whatever places of the seltau survive
    the elimination process. For “balsoi”, the surviving places
    of “banli” are b2 and b3, leading to the place structure:</p>
<pre>
<a id="7-4"
name="7-4">7.4)</a>  b1=s1 is a great soldier of army s2
        in property b2 by standard b3
</pre>
    just what appears in <a href="../5/#1">Example 5.1</a>. In fact,
    all place structures shown until now have been in the correct
    order by the conventions of this section, though the fact has
    been left tacit until now. 

    <p>The motivation for this rule is the parallelism between the
    lujvo bridi-schema</p>
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">7.5)</a>  b1 bansoi s2 b2 b3
    b1 is-a-great-soldier of-army-s2
        in-property-b2 by-standard-b3
</pre>
    and the more or less equivalent bridi-schema 
<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">7.6)</a>  b1 sonci s2 gi’e banli b2 b3
    b1 is-a-soldier of-army-s2 and
        is-great in-property-b2
        by-standard-b3
</pre>
    where “gi’e” is the Lojban word for “and” when placed
    between two partial bridi, as explained in <a
    href="../../14/1/">Chapter 14</a>. 

    <p>Asymmetrical lujvo like “gerzda”, on the other hand,
    employ a different rule. The seltau places are inserted not at
    the end of the place structure, but rather immediately after
    the tertau place which is equivalent to the first place of the
    seltau. Consider “dalmikce”, meaning “veterinarian”: its
    veljvo is “danlu mikce”, or “animal doctor”. The place
    structures for those gismu are:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="7-7"
name="7-7">7.7)</a>  “danlu”: d1 is an animal of species d2
    “mikce”: m1 is a doctor to patient m2 for ailment m3
        using treatment m4
</pre>
    and the lujvo place structure is: 
<pre>
<a id="7-8"
name="7-8">7.8)</a>  m1 is a doctor for animal m2=d1 of species d2
        for ailment m3 using treatment m4
</pre>
    Since the shared place is m2=d1, the animal patient, the
    remaining seltau place d2 is inserted immediately after the
    shared place; then the remaining tertau places form the last
    two places of the lujvo.
