        <h3>10. Description sumti</h3>

  <p>Often we wish to talk about things other than the speaker, the
  listener and things we can point to. Let’s say I want to talk
  about a talker other than “mi”. What I want to talk about would
  naturally fit into the first place of “tavla”. Lojban, it turns
  out, has an operator that pulls this first place out of a selbri
  and converts it to a sumti called a “description sumti”. The
  description sumti “le tavla ku” means “the talker”, and may
  be used wherever any sumti may be used.</p>

  <p>For example,

<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">10.1)</a>    mi tavla do le tavla ku
       -- ===== -- -----------
</pre>

  means the same as 

<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">10.2)</a>    I talk to you about the talker
</pre>

  where “the talker” is presumably someone other than me, though
  not necessarily.</p> 

  <p>Similarly “le sutra tavla ku” is “the fast talker”, and
  “le sutra te tavla ku” is “the fast subject of talk” or “the
  subject of fast talk”. Which of these related meanings is
  understood will depend on the context in which the expression is
  used. The most plausible interpretation within the context will
  generally be assumed by a listener to be the intended one.</p>

  <p>In many cases the word “ku” may be omitted. In particular,
  it is never necessary in a description at the end of a sentence,
  so:

<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">10.3)</a>    mi tavla   do  le tavla
       -- =====   --  -----------
       I  talk-to you about-the talker
</pre>

  means exactly the same thing as <a href="../10/#1">Example 10.1</a>.</p> 

  <p>There is a problem when we want to say “The fast one is
  talking.” The “obvious” translation “le sutra tavla” turns
  out to mean “the fast talker”, and has no selbri at all. To
  solve this problem we can use the word “cu”, which so far has
  always been optional, in front of the selbri.</p>

  <p>The word “cu” has no meaning, and exists only to mark the
  beginning of the selbri within the bridi, separating it from a
  previous sumti. It comes before any other part of the selbri,
  including other cmavo like “se” or “te”. Thus:

<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">10.4)</a>    le sutra tavla
       --------------
       The fast talker

<a id="5" name="5">10.5)</a> le sutra cu tavla
    --------    =====
    The fast one is talking.

<a id="6" name="6">10.6)</a> le sutra se tavla
    -----------------
    The fast talked-to one

<a id="7" name="7">10.7)</a> le sutra cu se tavla
    --------    ========
    The fast one is talked to.
</pre>
</p>

  <p>Consider the following more complex example, with two description
  sumti.

<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">10.8)</a>    mi [cu] tavla   le vecnu [ku] le blari'o [ku]
       --      =====   ------------- ---------------
       I       talk-to the seller    about the blue-green-thing.
</pre>
</p>

  <p>The sumti “le vecnu” contains the selbri “vecnu”, which
  has the “seller” in the x1 place, and uses it in this sentence
  to describe a particular “seller” that the speaker has in mind
  (one that he or she probably expects the listener will also know
  about). Similarly, the speaker has a particular blue-green thing
  in mind, which is described using “le” to mark “blari'o”, a
  selbri whose first sumti is something blue-green.</p>

  <p>It is safe to omit both occurrences of “ku” in 
  <a href="../10/#8">Example 10.8</a>, and it is also safe to omit the “cu”.</p>
