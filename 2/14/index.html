        <h3>14. Vocatives and commands</h3>

  <p>You may call someone's attention to the fact that you are
  addressing them by using ``doi'' followed by their name. The
  sentence</p>

<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">14.1)</a>    doi djan.
</pre>

  means ``Oh, John, I'm talking to you''. It also has the effect of
  setting the value of ``do''; ``do'' now refers to ``John'' until
  it is changed in some way in the conversation. Note that 
  <a href="../14/#1">Example 14.1</a>

  is not a bridi, but it is a legitimate Lojban sentence
  nevertheless; it is known as a ``vocative phrase''. 
  <p>Other cmavo can be used instead of ``doi'' in a vocative
  phrase, with a different significance. For example, the cmavo
  ``coi'' means ``hello'' and ``co'o'' means ``good-bye''. Either
  word may stand alone, they may follow one another, or either may
  be followed by a pause and a name. (Vocative phrases with ``doi''
  do not need a pause before the name.)</p>

<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">14.2)</a>    coi. djan.
    Hello, John.

<a id="3" name="3">14.3)</a> co'o. djan.
    Good-bye, John.
</pre>

  Commands are expressed in Lojban by a simple variation of the
  main bridi structure. If you say 
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">14.4)</a>    do tavla
    -- =====
    You are-talking.
</pre>

  you are simply making a statement of fact. In order to issue a
  command in Lojban, substitute the word ``ko'' for ``do''. The
  bridi 
  <p>
  </p>

<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">14.5)</a>    ko tavla
    -- =====
</pre>

  instructs the listener to do whatever is necessary to make 
  <a href="../14/#4">Example 14.4</a>

  true; it means ``Talk!'' Other examples: 
<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">14.6)</a>    ko sutra
    -- =====
    Be fast!
</pre>

  <p>The ``ko'' need not be in the x1 place, but rather can occur
  anywhere a sumti is allowed, leading to possible Lojban commands
  that are very unlike English commands:</p>

<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">14.7)</a>    mi tavla ko
    -- ===== --
    Be talked to by me
    Let me talk to you.
</pre>

  <p>The cmavo ``ko'' can fill any appropriate sumti place, and can
  be used as often as is appropriate for the selbri:</p>

<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">14.8)</a>    ko kurji ko
    -- ===== --
</pre>

  and 
  <p>
  </p>

<pre>
<a id="9" name="9">14.9)</a>    ko ko kurji
    -- -- =====
</pre>

  both mean ``You take care of you'' and ``Be taken care of by
  you'', or to put it colloquially, ``Take care of yourself''.
