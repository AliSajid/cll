        <h3><a id="7" name="7">7. Varying the order of sumti</h3>

  <p>For one reason or another you may want to change the order,
  placing one particular sumti at the front of the bridi. The cmavo
  ``se'', when placed before the last word of the selbri, will
  switch the meanings of the first and second sumti places. So</p>

<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">7.1)</a>  mi tavla do ti
    -- ===== -- --
    I talk to you about this.
</pre>

  has the same meaning as 
<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">7.2)</a>  do se tavla mi ti
    -- ======== -- --
    You are talked to by me about this.
</pre>

  The cmavo ``te'', when used in the same location, switches the
  meanings of the first and the third sumti places. 
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">7.3)</a>  mi tavla do ti
    -- ===== -- --
    I talk to you about this.
</pre>

  has the same meaning as 
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">7.4)</a>  ti te tavla do mi
    -- ======== -- --
    This is talked about to you by me.
</pre>

  <p>Note that only the first and third sumti have switched places;
  the second sumti has remained in the second place.</p>

  <p>The cmavo ``ve'' and ``xe'' switch the first and fourth sumti
  places, and the first and fifth sumti places, respectively. These
  changes in the order of places are known as ``conversions'', and
  the ``se'', ``te'', ``ve'', and ``xe'' cmavo are said to convert
  the selbri.</p>

  <p>More than one of these operators may be used on a given selbri
  at one time, and in such a case they are evaluated from left to
  right. However, in practice they are used one at a time, as there
  are better tools for complex manipulation of the sumti places.
  See 
  <a href="../../5/1/">Chapter 5</a>

  for details.</p>

  <p>The effect is similar to what in English is called the
  ``passive voice''. In Lojban, the converted selbri has a new
  place structure that is renumbered to reflect the place reversal,
  thus having effects when such a conversion is used in combination
  with other constructs such as ``le selbri [ku]'' (see 
  <a href=../10/>Section 10</a>

  ).</p>
