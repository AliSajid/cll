  <title>Chapter 4 The Shape Of Words To Come: Lojban Morphology</title>
  <section xml:id="cll_chapter4-section1">
    <title>1. Introductory</title>
    <para>Morphology is the part of grammar that deals with the form of words. Lojban's morphology is fairly simple compared to that of many languages, because Lojban words don't change form depending on how they are used. English has only a small number of such changes compared to languages like Russian, but it does have changes like 
    <quote>boys</quote>as the plural of 
<!-- ^^   plural: Lojban contrasted with English in necessity of marking, 120; Lojban equivalent of, 443; meaning of le with, 123 -->
<indexterm><primary>plural</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>boy</quote>, or 
    <quote>walked</quote>as the past-tense form of 
    <quote>walk</quote>. To make plurals or past tenses in Lojban, you add separate words to the sentence that express the number of boys, or the time when the walking was going on.</para>
    <para>However, Lojban does have what is called 
    <quote>derivational morphology</quote>: the capability of building new words from old words. In addition, the form of words tells us something about their grammatical uses, and sometimes about the means by which they entered the language. Lojban has very orderly rules for the formation of words of various types, both the words that already exist and new words yet to be created by speakers and writers.</para>

    <para>A stream of Lojban sounds can be uniquely broken up into its component words according to specific rules. These so-called 
    <quote>morphology rules</quote>are summarized in this chapter. (However, a detailed algorithm for breaking sounds into words has not yet been fully debugged, and so is not presented in this book.) First, here are some conventions used to talk about groups of Lojban letters, including vowels and consonants.</para>

    <para>Lojban has three basic word classes - parts of speech - in contrast to the eight that are traditional in English. These three classes are called cmavo, brivla, and cmene. Each of these classes has uniquely identifying properties - an arrangement of letters that allows the word to be uniquely and unambiguously recognized as a separate word in a string of Lojban, upon either reading or hearing, and as belonging to a specific word-class.</para>

    <para>The first group of Lojban words discussed in this chapter are the cmavo. They are the structure words that hold the Lojban language together. They often have no semantic meaning in themselves, though they may affect the semantics of brivla to which they are attached. The cmavo include the equivalent of English articles, conjunctions, prepositions, numbers, and punctuation marks. There are over a hundred subcategories of cmavo, known as

    <xref linkend="cll_chapter19" />and summarized in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter20" />.</para>
    <para>Standard cmavo occur in four forms defined by their word structure. Here are some examples of the various forms:</para>

    <para>In addition, there is the cmavo 
    <quote>.y.</quote>(remember that 
    <quote>y</quote>is not a V), which must have pauses before and after it.</para>
    <para>A simple cmavo thus has the property of having only one or two vowels, or of having a single consonant followed by one or two vowels. Words consisting of three or more vowels in a row, or a single consonant followed by three or more vowels, are also of cmavo form, but are reserved for experimental use: a few examples are

<indexterm><primary>ku'a</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>sau'e</quote>, and 
    <quote>bai'ai</quote>. All CVV cmavo beginning with the letter 
    <quote>x</quote>are also reserved for experimental use. In general, though, the form of a cmavo tells you little or nothing about its grammatical use.</para>
    <para>
    <quote>Experimental use</quote>means that the language designers will not assign any standard meaning or usage to these words, and words and usages coined by Lojban speakers will not appear in official dictionaries for the indefinite future. Experimental-use words provide an escape hatch for adding grammatical mechanisms (as opposed to semantic concepts) the need for which was not foreseen.</para>
    <para>The cmavo of VV-form include not only the diphthongs and vowel pairs listed in 
<!-- ^^   vowel pairs: contrasted with diphthongs, 34; definition of, 34; grouping of, 35; involving y, 35; list of, 35; use of apostrophe in, 34 -->

        <description>.uu</description>
      </cmavo-entry>
    </cmavo-list>
    <para>In addition, cmavo can have the form 
    <quote>Cy</quote>, a consonant followed by the letter 
    <quote>y</quote>. These cmavo represent letters of the Lojban alphabet, and are discussed in detail in 
<!-- ^^   Lojban alphabet, 29 -->
<indexterm><primary>Lojban alphabet</primary></indexterm>
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter17" />.</para>
    <para>Compound cmavo are sequences of cmavo attached together to form a single written word. A compound cmavo is always identical in meaning and in grammatical use to the separated sequence of simple cmavo from which it is composed. These words are written in compound form merely to save visual space, and to ease the reader's burden in identifying when the component cmavo are acting together.</para>
    <para>Compound cmavo, while not visually short like their components, can be readily identified by two characteristics:</para>

    <para>Predicate words, called 
    <quote>brivla</quote>, are at the core of Lojban. They carry most of the semantic information in the language. They serve as the equivalent of English nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, all in a single part of speech.</para>

    <para>Every brivla belongs to one of three major subtypes. These subtypes are defined by the form, or morphology, of the word - all words of a particular structure can be assigned by sight or sound to a particular type (cmavo, brivla, or cmene) and subtype. Knowing the type and subtype then gives you, the reader or listener, significant clues to the meaning and the origin of the word, even if you have never heard the word before.</para>
<!-- ^^   have never: example, 227 -->
<indexterm><primary>have never</primary></indexterm>
    <para>The same principle allows you, when speaking or writing, to invent new brivla for new concepts 
    <quote>on the fly</quote>; yet it offers people that you are trying to communicate with a good chance to figure out your meaning. In this way, Lojban has a flexible vocabulary which can be expanded indefinitely.</para>

    <para>All brivla have the following properties:</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>always end in a vowel;</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>

        <para>always are stressed on the next-to-the-last (penultimate) syllable; this implies that they have two or more syllables.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>The presence of a consonant pair distinguishes brivla from cmavo and their compounds. The final vowel distinguishes brivla from cmene, which always end in a consonant. Thus 
    <quote>da'amei</quote>must be a compound cmavo because it lacks a consonant pair; 
    <quote>lojban.</quote>must be a name because it lacks a final vowel.</para>
    <para>Thus,

    <quote>y</quote>letters even though the

    <title>4. gismu</title>
    <para>The gismu, or Lojban root words, are those brivla representing concepts most basic to the language. The gismu were chosen for various reasons: some represent concepts that are very familiar and basic; some represent concepts that are frequently used in other languages; some were added because they would be helpful in constructing more complex words; some because they represent fundamental Lojban concepts (like 
    <quote>cmavo</quote>and 
    <quote>gismu</quote>themselves).</para>
    <para>The gismu do not represent any sort of systematic partitioning of semantic space. Some gismu may be superfluous, or appear for historical reasons: the gismu list was being collected for almost 35 years and was only weeded out once. Instead, the intention is that the gismu blanket semantic space: they make it possible to talk about the entire range of human concerns.</para>
    <para>There are about 1350 gismu. In learning Lojban, you need only to learn most of these gismu and their combining forms (known as 
<!-- ^^   learning Lojban: magnitude of task, 53 -->

    <quote>rafsi</quote>) as well as perhaps 200 major cmavo, and you will be able to communicate effectively in the language. This may sound like a lot, but it is a small number compared to the vocabulary needed for similar communications in other languages.</para>
    <para>All gismu have very strong form restrictions. Using the conventions defined in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter4-section1" />, all gismu are of the forms CVC/CV or CCVCV. They must meet the rules for all brivla given in

        <para>always contain exactly one consonant pair, which is a permissible initial pair (CC) if it's at the beginning of the gismu, but otherwise only has to be a permissible pair (C/C);</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>are always stressed on the first syllable (since that is penultimate).</para>

    <para>The five letter length distinguishes gismu from lujvo and fu'ivla. In addition, no gismu contains

    <quote>brode</quote>, 
    <quote>brodi</quote>, 
    <quote>brodo</quote>, and 
    <quote>brodu</quote>, no two gismu differ only in the final vowel. Furthermore, the set of gismu was specifically designed to reduce the likelihood that two similar sounding gismu could be confused. For example, because 
    <quote>gismu</quote>is in the set of gismu, 
    <quote>kismu</quote>, 
    <quote>xismu</quote>,

    <para>Almost all Lojban gismu are constructed from pieces of words drawn from other languages, specifically Chinese, English, Hindi, Spanish, Russian, and Arabic, the six most widely spoken natural languages. For a given concept, words in the six languages that represent that concept were written in Lojban phonetics. Then a gismu was selected to maximize the recognizability of the Lojban word for speakers of the six languages by weighting the inclusion of the sounds drawn from each language by the number of speakers of that language.

    <title>5. lujvo</title>
    <para>When specifying a concept that is not found among the gismu (or, more specifically, when the relevant gismu seems too general in meaning), a Lojbanist generally attempts to express the concept as a tanru. Lojban tanru are an elaboration of the concept of 
    <quote>metaphor</quote>used in English. In Lojban, any brivla can be used to modify another brivla. The first of the pair modifies the second. This modification is usually restrictive - the modifying brivla reduces the broader sense of the modified brivla to form a more narrow, concrete, or specific concept. Modifying brivla may thus be seen as acting like English adverbs or adjectives. For example,</para>

    <para>The simplest Lojban tanru are pairings of two concepts or ideas. Such tanru take two simpler ideas that can be represented by gismu and combine them into a single more complex idea. Two-part tanru may then be recombined in pairs with other tanru, or with individual gismu, to form more complex or more specific ideas, and so on.</para>
    <para>The meaning of a tanru is usually at least partly ambiguous: 
    <quote>skami pilno</quote>could refer to a computer that is a user, or to a user of computers. There are a variety of ways that the modifier component can be related to the modified component. It is also possible to use cmavo within tanru to provide variations (or to prevent ambiguities) of meaning.</para>
    <para>Making tanru is essentially a poetic or creative act, not a science. While the syntax expressing the grouping relationships within tanru is unambiguous, tanru are still semantically ambiguous, since the rules defining the relationships between the gismu are flexible.

    <para>In addition to these two forms, each gismu may have up to three additional short rafsi, three letters long. All short rafsi have one of the forms CVC, CCV, or CVV. The total number of rafsi forms that are assigned to a gismu depends on how useful the gismu is, or is presumed to be, in making lujvo, when compared to other gismu that could be assigned the rafsi.</para>
    <para>For example, 
    <quote>zmadu</quote>( 
    <quote>more than</quote>) has the two short rafsi 
    <quote>zma</quote>and 
    <quote>mau</quote>(in addition to its unreduced rafsi 
<!-- ^^   mau, 203, 432; avoiding in favor of seme'a, 203 -->
<indexterm><primary>mau</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>zmad</quote>and 
    <quote>zmadu</quote>), because a vast number of lujvo have been created based on 
    <quote>zmadu</quote>, corresponding in general to English comparative adjectives ending in 
<!-- ^^   adjectives: brivla as Lojban equivalents, 52 -->
<indexterm><primary>adjectives</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>-er</quote>such as 
    <quote>whiter</quote>(Lojban 
    <quote>labmau</quote>). On the other hand, 
    <quote>bakri</quote>( 
    <quote>chalk</quote>) has no short rafsi and few lujvo.</para>
    <para>There are at most one CVC-form, one CCV-form, and one CVV-form rafsi per gismu. In fact, only a tiny handful of gismu have both a CCV-form and a CVV-form rafsi assigned, and still fewer have all three forms of short rafsi. However, gismu with both a CVC-form and another short rafsi are fairly common, partly because more possible CVC-form rafsi exist. Yet CVC-form rafsi, even though they are fairly easy to remember, cannot be used at the end of a lujvo (because lujvo must end in vowels), so justifying the assignment of an additional short rafsi to many gismu.</para>

    <para>The intention was to use the available 
    <quote>rafsi space</quote>- the set of all possible short rafsi forms - in the most efficient way possible; the goal is to make the most-used lujvo as short as possible (thus maximizing the use of short rafsi), while keeping the rafsi very recognizable to anyone who knows the source gismu. For this reason, the letters in a rafsi have always been chosen from among the five letters of the corresponding gismu. As a result, there are a limited set of short rafsi available for assignment to each gismu. At most seven possible short rafsi are available for consideration (of which at most three can be used, as explained above).</para>

    <para>(In fact, 
    <quote>blaci</quote>has none of these short rafsi; they are all assigned to other gismu. Lojban speakers are not free to reassign any of the rafsi; the tables shown here are to help understand how the rafsi were chosen in the first place.)</para>
    <para>There are a few restrictions: a CVV-form rafsi without an apostrophe cannot exist unless the vowels make up one of the four diphthongs 
    <quote>ai</quote>, 
    <quote>ei</quote>, 
    <quote>oi</quote>, or 
    <quote>au</quote>; and a CCV-form rafsi is possible only if the two consonants form a permissible initial consonant pair (see 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter4-section1" />). Thus 
    <quote>mamta</quote>, which has the same form as 
    <quote>salci</quote>, can only have 
    <quote>mam</quote>, 
    <quote>mat</quote>, and 
    <quote>ma'a</quote>as possible rafsi: in fact, only 
<!-- ^^   ma'a, 146 -->
<indexterm><primary>ma'a</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>mam</quote>is assigned to it.</para>
    <para>Some cmavo also have associated rafsi, usually CVC-form. For example, the ten common numerical digits, which are all CV form cmavo, each have a CVC-form rafsi formed by adding a consonant to the cmavo. Most cmavo that have rafsi are ones used in composing tanru (for a complete list, see

      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>As noted above, CVC-form rafsi cannot appear as the final rafsi in a lujvo, because all lujvo must end with one or two vowels. As a brivla, a lujvo must also contain a consonant cluster within the first five letters - this ensures that they cannot be mistaken for compound cmavo. Of course, all lujvo have at least six letters since they have two or more rafsi, each at least three letters long; hence they cannot be confused with gismu.</para>
    <para>When attaching two rafsi together, it may be necessary to insert a hyphen letter. In Lojban, the term 
<!-- ^^   hyphen letter: definition, 59 -->
<indexterm><primary>hyphen letter</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>hyphen</quote>always refers to a letter, either the vowel 
    <quote>y</quote>or one of the consonants 
    <quote>r</quote>and 
    <quote>n</quote>. (The letter 
    <quote>l</quote>can also be a hyphen, but is not used as one in lujvo.)</para>
    <para>The 
    <quote>y</quote>-hyphen is used after a CVC-form rafsi when joining it with the following rafsi could result in an impermissible consonant pair, or when the resulting lujvo could fall apart into two or more words (either cmavo or gismu).</para>
    <para>Thus, the tanru 
    <quote>pante tavla</quote>( 
    <quote>protest talk</quote>) cannot produce the lujvo 
    <quote>patta'a</quote>, because 
    <quote>tt</quote>is not a permissible consonant pair; the lujvo must be 
    <quote>patyta'a</quote>. Similarly, the tanru 
    <quote>mudri siclu</quote>( 
    <quote>wooden whistle</quote>) cannot form the lujvo 
    <quote>mudsiclu</quote>; instead, 
    <quote>mudysiclu</quote>must be used. (Remember that 
    <quote>y</quote>is not counted in determining whether the first five letters of a brivla contain a consonant cluster: this is why.)</para>
    <para>The 
    <quote>y</quote>-hyphen is also used to attach a 4-letter rafsi, formed by dropping the final vowel of a gismu, to the following rafsi. (This procedure was shown, but not explained, in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter4-section6-example1" />to 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter4-section6-example5" />.)</para>
    <para>The lujvo forms 
    <quote>zunlyjamfu</quote>, 
    <quote>zunlyjma</quote>, 
    <quote>zuljamfu</quote>, and 
    <quote>zuljma</quote>are all legitimate and equivalent forms made from the tanru 
    <quote>zunle jamfu</quote>( 
    <quote>left foot</quote>). Of these, 
    <quote>zuljma</quote>is the preferred one since it is the shortest; it thus is likely to be the form listed in a Lojban dictionary.</para>
    <para>The 
    <quote>r</quote>-hyphen and its close relative, the 
    <quote>n</quote>-hyphen, are used in lujvo only after CVV-form rafsi. A hyphen is always required in a two-part lujvo of the form CVV-CVV, since otherwise there would be no consonant cluster.</para>
    <para>An 
    <quote>r-</quote>hyphen or 
    <quote>n</quote>-hyphen is also required after the CVV-form rafsi of any lujvo of the form CVV-CVC/CV or CVV-CCVCV since it would otherwise fall apart into a CVV-form cmavo and a gismu. In any lujvo with more than two parts, a CVV-form rafsi in the initial position must always be followed by a hyphen. If the hyphen were to be omitted, the supposed lujvo could be broken into smaller words without the hyphen: because the CVV-form rafsi would be interpreted as a cmavo, and the remainder of the word as a valid lujvo that is one rafsi shorter.</para>
    <para>An 
    <quote>n</quote>-hyphen is only used in place of an 
    <quote>r</quote>-hyphen when the following rafsi begins with 
    <quote>r</quote>. For example, the tanru 
    <quote>rokci renro</quote>( 
    <quote>rock throw</quote>) cannot be expressed as 
    <quote>ro'ire'o</quote>(which breaks up into two cmavo), nor can it be 
    <quote>ro'irre'o</quote>(which has an impermissible double consonant); the 
    <quote>n</quote>-hyphen is required, and the correct form of the hyphenated lujvo is 
    <quote>ro'inre'o</quote>. The same lujvo could also be expressed without hyphenation as 
    <quote>rokre'o</quote>.</para>
    <para>There is also a different way of building lujvo, or rather phrases which are grammatically and semantically equivalent to lujvo. You can make a phrase containing any desired words, joining each pair of them with the special cmavo 
    <quote>zei</quote>. Thus,</para>

    <para>Note that rafsi may not be used in

CVV rafsi look like words (specifically cmavo) but there can be no confusion between the two uses of the same letters, because cmavo appear only as separate words or in compound cmavo (which are really just a notation for writing separate but closely related words as if they were one); rafsi appear only as parts of lujvo.</para>

    <para>Stage 2 involves changing the foreign name to a Lojbanized name, as explained in

<!-- ^^   borrowing: four stages of, 61 -->
<indexterm><primary>borrowing</primary></indexterm>
    <para>Where a little more universality is desired, the word to be borrowed must be Lojbanized into one of several permitted forms. A rafsi is then usually attached to the beginning of the Lojbanized form, using a hyphen to ensure that the resulting word doesn't fall apart.</para>
    <para>The rafsi categorizes or limits the meaning of the fu'ivla; otherwise a word having several different jargon meanings in other languages would require the word-inventor to choose which meaning should be assigned to the fu'ivla, since fu'ivla (like other brivla) are not permitted to have more than one definition. Such a Stage 3 borrowing is the most common kind of fu'ivla.</para>

<!-- ^^   borrowing: four stages of, 61 -->
<indexterm><primary>borrowing</primary></indexterm>
    <para>Finally, Stage 4 fu'ivla do not have any rafsi classifier, and are used where a fu'ivla has become so common or so important that it must be made as short as possible. (See 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter4-section16" />for a proposal concerning Stage 4 fu'ivla.)</para>
    <para>The form of a fu'ivla reliably distinguishes it from both the gismu and the cmavo. Like cultural gismu, fu'ivla are generally based on a word from a single non-Lojban language. The word is 
    <quote>borrowed</quote>(actually 
    <quote>copied</quote>, hence the Lojban tanru 
    <quote>fukpi valsi</quote>) from the other language and Lojbanized - the phonemes are converted to their closest Lojban equivalent and modifications are made as necessary to make the word a legitimate Lojban fu'ivla-form word. All fu'ivla:</para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>must contain a consonant cluster in the first five letters of the word; if this consonant cluster is at the beginning, it must either be a permissible initial consonant pair, or a longer cluster such that each pair of adjacent consonants in the cluster is a permissible initial consonant pair: 
        <quote>spraile</quote>is acceptable, but not 
        <quote>ktraile</quote>or 
        <quote>trkaile</quote>;</para>

      </listitem>

        <para>must not be gismu or lujvo, or any combination of cmavo, gismu, and lujvo; furthermore, a fu'ivla with a CV cmavo joined to the front of it must not have the form of a lujvo (the so-called 
        <quote>slinku'i test</quote>, not discussed further in this book);</para>
<!-- ^^   slinku'i test: definition, 62 -->

      <listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>like other brivla, are stressed on the penultimate syllable.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>Note that consonant triples or larger clusters that are not at the beginning of a fu'ivla can be quite flexible, as long as all consonant pairs are permissible. There is no need to restrict fu'ivla clusters to permissible initial pairs except at the beginning.</para>
<!-- ^^   consonant triples, 37; restrictions on, 37 -->

    <para>This is a fairly liberal definition and allows quite a lot of possibilities within 
    <quote>fu'ivla space</quote>. Stage 3 fu'ivla can be made easily on the fly, as lujvo can, because the procedure for forming them always guarantees a word that cannot violate any of the rules. Stage 4 fu'ivla require running tests that are not simple to characterize or perform, and should be made only after deliberation and by someone knowledgeable about all the considerations that apply.</para>
    <para>Here is a simple and reliable procedure for making a non-Lojban word into a valid Stage 3 fu'ivla:</para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Eliminate all double consonants and silent letters.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Convert all sounds to their closest Lojban equivalents. Lojban 
        <quote>y</quote>, however, may not be used in any fu'ivla.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>If the last letter is not a vowel, modify the ending so that the word ends in a vowel, either by removing a final consonant or by adding a suggestively chosen final vowel.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>If the first letter is not a consonant, modify the beginning so that the word begins with a consonant, either by removing an initial vowel or adding a suggestively chosen initial consonant.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Prefix the result of steps 1-5 with a 4-letter rafsi that categorizes the fu'ivla into a 
        <quote>topic area</quote>. It is only safe to use a 4-letter rafsi; short rafsi sometimes produce invalid fu'ivla. Hyphenate the rafsi to the rest of the fu'ivla with an 
        <quote>r</quote>-hyphen; if that would produce a double 
        <quote>r</quote>, use an 
        <quote>n</quote>-hyphen instead; if the rafsi ends in 
        <quote>r</quote>and the rest of the fu'ivla begins with 
        <quote>n</quote>(or vice versa), or if the rafsi ends in "r" and the rest of the fu'ivla begins with "tc", "ts", "dj", or "dz" (using "n" would result in a phonotactically impermissible cluster), use an 
        <quote>l</quote>-hyphen. (This is the only use of 
        <quote>l</quote>-hyphen in Lojban.)</para>
        <para>Alternatively, if a CVC-form short rafsi is available it can be used instead of the long rafsi.</para>

    <para>The final arbiter of the correct form of a name is the person doing the naming, although most cultures grant people the right to determine how they want their own name to be spelled and pronounced. The English name 
    <quote>Mary</quote>can thus be Lojbanized as 
    <quote>meris.</quote>, 
    <quote>maris.</quote>, 
    <quote>meiris.</quote>, 
    <quote>merix.</quote>, or even 
    <quote>marys.</quote>. The last alternative is not pronounced much like its English equivalent, but may be desirable to someone who values spelling over pronunciation. The final consonant need not be an 
    <quote>s</quote>; there must, however, be some Lojban consonant at the end.</para>
    <para>Names are not permitted to have the sequences 
    <quote>la</quote>, 
    <quote>lai</quote>, or 
    <quote>doi</quote>embedded in them, unless the sequence is immediately preceded by a consonant. These minor restrictions are due to the fact that all Lojban cmene embedded in a speech stream will be preceded by one of these words or by a pause. With one of these words embedded, the cmene might break up into valid Lojban words followed by a shorter cmene. However, break-up cannot happen after a consonant, because that would imply that the word before the 
    <quote>la</quote>, or whatever, ended in a consonant without pause, which is impossible.</para>
    <para>For example, the invalid name 
    <quote>laplas.</quote>would look like the Lojban words 
    <quote>la plas.</quote>, and 
    <quote>ilanas.</quote>would be misunderstood as 
    <quote>.i la nas.</quote>. However, 
    <quote>NEderlants.</quote>cannot be misheard as 
    <quote>NEder lants.</quote>, because 
    <quote>NEder</quote>with no following pause is not a possible Lojban word.</para>
    <para>There are close alternatives to these forbidden sequences that can be used in Lojbanizing names, such as 
    <quote>ly</quote>, 
    <quote>lei</quote>, and 
    <quote>dai</quote>or

    <title>10. Considerations for making lujvo</title>
    <para>Given a tanru which expresses an idea to be used frequently, it can be turned into a lujvo by following the lujvo-making algorithm which is given in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter4-section11" />.</para>
    <para>In building a lujvo, the first step is to replace each gismu with a rafsi that uniquely represents that gismu. These rafsi are then attached together by fixed rules that allow the resulting compound to be recognized as a single word and to be analyzed in only one way.</para>
    <para>There are three other complications; only one is serious.</para>
    <para>The first is that there is usually more than one rafsi that can be used for each gismu. The one to be used is simply whichever one sounds or looks best to the speaker or writer. There are usually many valid combinations of possible rafsi. They all are equally valid, and all of them mean exactly the same thing. (The scoring algorithm given in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter4-section12" />is used to choose the standard form of the lujvo - the version which would be entered into a dictionary.)</para>
    <para>The second complication is the serious one. Remember that a tanru is ambiguous - it has several possible meanings. A lujvo, or at least one that would be put into the dictionary, has just a single meaning. Like a gismu, a lujvo is a predicate which encompasses one area of the semantic universe, with one set of places. Hopefully the meaning chosen is the most useful of the possible semantic spaces. A possible source of linguistic drift in Lojban is that as Lojbanic society evolves, the concept that seems the most useful one may change.</para>

<indexterm><primary>linguistic drift in Lojban</primary></indexterm>
<!-- ^^   linguistic drift, 4 -->
<indexterm><primary>linguistic drift</primary></indexterm>
    <para>You must also be aware of the possibility of some prior meaning of a new lujvo, especially if you are writing for posterity. If a lujvo is invented which involves the same tanru as one that is in the dictionary, and is assigned a different meaning (or even just a different place structure), linguistic drift results. This isn't necessarily bad. Every natural language does it. But in communication, when you use a meaning different from the dictionary definition, someone else may use the dictionary and therefore misunderstand you. You can use the cmavo

    <xref linkend="cll_chapter19" />) before a newly coined lujvo to indicate that it may have a non-dictionary meaning.</para>
    <para>The essential nature of human communication is that if the listener understands, then all is well. Let this be the ultimate guideline for choosing meanings and place structures for invented lujvo.</para>
    <para>The third complication is also simple, but tends to scare new Lojbanists with its implications. It is based on Zipf's Law, which says that the length of words is inversely proportional to their usage. The shortest words are those which are used more; the longest ones are used less. Conversely, commonly used concepts will be tend to be abbreviated. In English, we have abbreviations and acronyms and jargon, all of which represent complex ideas that are used often by small groups of people, so they shortened them to convey more information more rapidly.</para>

<!-- ^^   acronyms: as lerfu strings using "me", 424; using names based on lerfu words, 423 -->
<indexterm><primary>acronyms</primary></indexterm>
    <para>Therefore, given a complicated tanru with grouping markers, abstraction markers, and other cmavo in it to make it syntactically unambiguous, the psychological basis of Zipf's Law may compel the lujvo-maker to drop some of the cmavo to make a shorter (technically incorrect) tanru, and then use that tanru to make the lujvo.</para>
<!-- ^^   Zipf's Law, 69 -->
<indexterm><primary>Zipf's Law</primary></indexterm>
<!-- ^^   basis: example, 317 -->
<indexterm><primary>basis</primary></indexterm>
    <para>This doesn't lead to ambiguity, as it might seem to. A given lujvo still has exactly one meaning and place structure. It is just that more than one tanru is competing for the same lujvo. But more than one meaning for the tanru was already competing for the 
    <quote>right</quote>to define the meaning of the lujvo. Someone has to use judgment in deciding which one meaning is to be chosen over the others.</para>
    <para>If the lujvo made by a shorter form of tanru is in use, or is likely to be useful for another meaning, the decider then retains one or more of the cmavo, preferably ones that set this meaning apart from the shorter form meaning that is used or anticipated. As a rule, therefore, the shorter lujvo will be used for a more general concept, possibly even instead of a more frequent word. If both words are needed, the simpler one should be shorter. It is easier to add a cmavo to clarify the meaning of the more complex term than it is to find a good alternate tanru for the simpler term.</para>
<!-- ^^   anticipated: example, 316 -->
<indexterm><primary>anticipated</primary></indexterm>
    <para>And of course, we have to consider the listener. On hearing an unknown word, the listener will decompose it and get a tanru that makes no sense or the wrong sense for the context. If the listener realizes that the grouping operators may have been dropped out, he or she may try alternate groupings, or try inserting an abstraction operator if that seems plausible. (The grouping of tanru is explained in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter5" />; abstraction is explained in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter11" />.) Plausibility is the key to learning new ideas and to evaluating unfamiliar lujvo.</para>

    <title>13. lujvo-making examples</title>
    <para>This section contains examples of making and scoring lujvo. First, we will start with the tanru 
    <quote>gerku zdani</quote>( 
    <quote>dog house</quote>) and construct a lujvo meaning 
<!-- ^^   lujvo meaning, 274 -->

<indexterm><primary>dog house</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>doghouse</quote>, that is, a house where a dog lives. We will use a brute-force application of the algorithm in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter4-section12" />, using every possible rafsi.</para>
    <para>The rafsi for 
    <quote>gerku</quote>are:</para>
    <programlisting xml:space="preserve">
          -ger-, -ge'u-, -gerk-, -gerku
</programlisting>
    <para>The rafsi for 
    <quote>zdani</quote>are:</para>
    <programlisting xml:space="preserve">
          -zda-, -zdan-, -zdani.
</programlisting>
    <para>Step 1 of the algorithm directs us to use 
    <quote>-ger-</quote>, 
    <quote>-ge'u-</quote>and 
    <quote>-gerk-</quote>as possible rafsi for 
    <quote>gerku</quote>; Step 2 directs us to use 
    <quote>-zda-</quote>and 
    <quote>-zdani</quote>as possible rafsi for 
    <quote>zdani</quote>. The six possible forms of the lujvo are then:</para>
    <programlisting xml:space="preserve">
          ger-zda
          ger-zdani
          ge'u-zda
          ge'u-zdani
          gerk-zda
          gerk-zdani
</programlisting>
    <para>We must then insert appropriate hyphens in each case. The first two forms need no hyphenation: 
<!-- ^^   hyphens: use of, 59 -->
<indexterm><primary>hyphens</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>ge</quote>cannot fall off the front, because the following word would begin with 
    <quote>rz</quote>, which is not a permissible initial consonant pair. So the lujvo forms are 
    <quote>gerzda</quote>and 
    <quote>gerzdani</quote>.</para>
    <para>The third form, 
    <quote>ge'u-zda</quote>, needs no hyphen, because even though the first rafsi is CVV, the second one is CCV, so there is a consonant cluster in the first five letters. So 
    <quote>ge'uzda</quote>is this form of the lujvo.</para>
    <para>The fourth form, 
    <quote>ge'u-zdani</quote>, however, requires an 
    <quote>r</quote>-hyphen; otherwise, the 
    <quote>ge'u-</quote>part would fall off as a cmavo. So this form of the lujvo is 
    <quote>ge'urzdani</quote>.</para>
    <para>The last two forms require 
    <quote>y</quote>-hyphens, as all 4-letter rafsi do, and so are 
<!-- ^^   hyphens: use of, 59 -->
<indexterm><primary>hyphens</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>gerkyzda</quote>and 
    <quote>gerkyzdani</quote>respectively.</para>
    <para>The scoring algorithm is heavily weighted in favor of short lujvo, so we might expect that 
    <quote>gerzda</quote>would win. Its L score is 6, its A score is 0, its H score is 0, its R score is 12, and its V score is 3, for a final score of 5878. The other forms have scores of 7917, 6367, 9506, 8008, and 10047 respectively. Consequently, this lujvo would probably appear in the dictionary in the form 
    <quote>gerzda</quote>.</para>
    <para>For the next example, we will use the tanru 
    <quote>bloti klesi</quote>( 
    <quote>boat class</quote>) presumably referring to the category (rowboat, motorboat, cruise liner) into which a boat falls. We will omit the long rafsi from the process, since lujvo containing long rafsi are almost never preferred by the scoring algorithm when there are short rafsi available.</para>

    <para>The rafsi for 
    <quote>bloti</quote>are 
    <quote>-lot-</quote>, 
    <quote>-blo-</quote>, and 
    <quote>-lo'i-</quote>; for 
    <quote>klesi</quote>they are 
    <quote>-kle-</quote>and 
    <quote>-lei-</quote>. Both these gismu are among the handful which have both CVV-form and CCV-form rafsi, so there is an unusual number of possibilities available for a two-part tanru:</para>
    <programlisting xml:space="preserve">
      lotkle      blokle      lo'ikle 
<!-- not a cmavo list -->
          lotlei      blolei      lo'irlei
</programlisting>
    <para>Only 
    <quote>lo'irlei</quote>requires hyphenation (to avoid confusion with the cmavo sequence 
    <quote>lo'i lei</quote>). All six forms are valid versions of the lujvo, as are the six further forms using long rafsi; however, the scoring algorithm produces the following results:</para>
<!-- ^^   long rafsi: definition, 57 -->
<indexterm><primary>long rafsi</primary></indexterm>
    <programlisting xml:space="preserve">
          lotkle  5878      blokle  5858      lo'ikle  6367 
<!-- not a cmavo list -->
          lotlei  5867      blolei  5847      lo'irlei 7456
</programlisting>

Cultural gismu are used for words that have local importance to a particular culture; other cultures or languages may have no word for the concept at all, or may borrow the word from its home culture, just as Lojban does. In such a case, the gismu algorithm, which uses weighted averages, doesn't accurately represent the frequency of usage of the individual concept. Cultural gismu are not even required to be based on the six major languages.</para>

    <title>16. rafsi fu'ivla: a proposal</title>
    <para>The list of cultures represented by gismu, given in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter4-section15" />, is unavoidably controversial. Much time has been spent debating whether this or that culture 
    <quote>deserves a gismu</quote>or 
    <quote>must languish in fu'ivla space</quote>. To help defuse this argument, a last-minute proposal was made when this book was already substantially complete. I have added it here with experimental status: it is not yet a standard part of Lojban, since all its implications have not been tested in open debate, and it affects a part of the language (lujvo-making) that has long been stable, but is known to be fragile in the face of small changes. (Many attempts were made to add general mechanisms for making lujvo that contained fu'ivla, but all failed on obvious or obscure counterexamples; finally the general 
    <quote>zei</quote>mechanism was devised instead.)</para>
    <para>The first part of the proposal is uncontroversial and involves no change to the language mechanisms. All valid Type 4 fu'ivla of the form CCVVCV would be reserved for cultural brivla analogous to those described in

    <para>The second, and fully experimental, part of the proposal is to allow rafsi to be formed from these cultural fu'ivla by removing the final vowel and treating the result as a 4-letter rafsi (although it would contain five letters, not four). These rafsi could then be used on a par with all other rafsi in forming lujvo. The tanru</para>
