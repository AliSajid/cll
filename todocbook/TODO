==================
  Instructions For Helpers
==================
Fix the chapter name so it's just the second part, i.e.

    <title>Chapter 5
      <quote>Pretty Little Girls' School</quote>: The Structure Of Lojban selbri</title>

becomes:

    <title><quote>Pretty Little Girls' School</quote>: The Structure Of Lojban selbri</title>

Make sure the <interlinear-gloss> bits look right (which is why the
columns are so spaced out).

==================
  Data
==================
- lojban words, lojban phrases, terms of art ("abstraction"),
  others?... should each have their own index

==================
  Display
==================
- links to examples should *say* "example N"; easy to test from the
  index
- links to sections should say the number of section and chapter
- examples should be 5.2.1 rather than 5.6 for the first example in
  section 2 of chatpre 5

==================
  Both/Other
==================
- make sure backwards-compatible anchors exist
