  Instructions For Helpers
==================

Fix the chapter name so it's just the second part, i.e.

    <title>Chapter 5
      <quote>Pretty Little Girls' School</quote>: The Structure Of Lojban selbri</title>

becomes:

    <title><quote>Pretty Little Girls' School</quote>: The Structure Of Lojban selbri</title>

Make sure the <interlinear-gloss> bits look right (which is why the
columns are so spaced out).

 ------

Fix IDs/tags.  A command like the following should do the trick:

  sed -i 's/"cll_chapter5"/"selbri"/g' [0-9]*.xml

Please run "git diff" afterwards to make sure it did what you
expected.  Check in as often as you like (to make the diffs
manageable).

We want short and meaningful; these are used to make file names and
so on.  If multi-word, please make a slug (see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slug_%28web_publishing%29 ); we are
using - based slugs rather than _ based, so drop all special
characters, lowercase, replace space with -.

Do this for all sections.  Feel free to do it for examples too if an
example has an obvious title.  The important thing here is that
*NOTHING* mentions a fixed number!  *NOWHERE* in the docbook should
*ANYTHING* be aware that it is in chapter 20 or section 7 or
anything like that.  This is to give us the freedom to move things
around later.

Numeric-based stuff will all be autogenerated during processing,
based on the current state of the docs.


==================
  Data
==================
- lojban words, lojban phrases, terms of art ("abstraction"),
  others?... should each have their own index
- cll_chapter5-section1 should be content-words-brivla or so ; those
  IDs should not change when things are moved around

==================
  Display
==================
- links to examples should *say* "example N"; easy to test from the
  index
- links to sections should say the number of section and chapter
- examples should be 5.2.1 rather than 5.6 for the first example in
  section 2 of chatpre 5

==================
  Both/Other
==================
- make sure backwards-compatible anchors exist
  - Ideally, make sure they are autogenerated as part of the HTML
    production.
- Similarily, generate more-readable anchors based on current
  section number and such
