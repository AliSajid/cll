  Instructions For Helpers
==================

Most of the below is intended to be done as needed as you review a
particular chapter/section.  It looks like more complexity than it
actually is; you'll get used to it.

    SAY HERE WHAT YOU'VE DONE, including parts you haven't completed
    (like index work).

Robin Powell: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3
Zort: Chapter 3 except index work and examples

 ------

Ignore Chapter 2 for now.

 ------

Fix the chapter name so it's just the second part, i.e.

    <title>Chapter 5
      <quote>Pretty Little Girls' School</quote>: The Structure Of Lojban selbri</title>

becomes:

    <title><quote>Pretty Little Girls' School</quote>: The Structure Of Lojban selbri</title>

Make sure the <interlinear-gloss> bits look right (which is why the
columns are so spaced out).

 ------

Fix IDs/tags.  A command like the following should do the trick:

  sed -i 's/"cll_chapter5"/"chapter-selbri"/g' [0-9]*.xml

BUT FIRST: check that it doesn't already exist:

  grep '"chapter-selbri"' [0-9]*.xml

because duplicates would really suck.

Please run "git diff" afterwards to make sure it did what you
expected.  Check in as often as you like (to make the diffs
manageable).

We want short and meaningful; these are used to make file names and
so on.  If multi-word, please make a slug (see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slug_%28web_publishing%29 ); we are
using - based slugs rather than _ based, so drop all special
characters, lowercase, replace space with -.

Make sure that the ids for chapters have "chapter-" at the start,
"section-" for the sections, and "example-" for the examples; we
might need them for auto-processing.

Do this for all sections.  Feel free to do it for examples too if an
example has an obvious title, but it's much less important there, so
not worth spending time on for the first pass.

The important thing here is that *NOTHING* mentions a fixed number!
*NOWHERE* in the docbook should *ANYTHING* be aware that it is in
chapter 20 or section 7 or anything like that.  This is to give us
the freedom to move things around later.

Numeric-based stuff will all be autogenerated during processing,
based on the current state of the docs.

THERE IS ONE EXCEPTION: DO NOT change anchors that are one to three
pairs of letters and numbers, like this:

  <anchor xml:id="c5e1d5" />

They are going to be needed down the road to provide backwards
compatability.  Don't touch them.

 ------

 DO NOT TOUCH THE INDEX ENTRIES RIGHT NOW.  I think I've found a way
 to automate them.

With the caveat that indexterm entries for examples should look
exactly like this:

<indexterm><primary>[item]</primary><secondary>example</secondary></indexterm>

, do feel free to add index entries where they seem useful.  It's
unlikely that we can ever have a too-thorough index (and it's a lot
easier to cut the thing down than to grow it anyways).

 ------

Feel free to do visual cleanup *of the source*; don't worry about
how crappy the *output* looks, we're only doing data structures
right now.  In particular, there are a lot of elements with no space
after their terminators; it doesn't really matter, but it's
annoying.

 ------

If you see a <quote>...</quote> around Lojban text, replace it with
<jbophrase>...</jbophrase>.  There are lots of these.

Also, use <jbophrase valid="false">...</jbophrase> for na gendra and
<jbophrase valid="iffy">...</jbophrase> for na smudra

 ------

<programlisting> is bad; change it.  If you can't figure out how to
change it, or think it's actually correct in some particular place,
post to the BPFK list.

 ------

If an example/interlinear-gloss consists solely of English, replace
the <interlinear-gloss>...</interlinear-gloss> with <para>...</para>

 ------

  DO NOT TOUCH THE INDEX ENTRIES RIGHT NOW.  I think I've found a
  way to automate them.

    YOU CAN SKIP THIS PART; it's easy to check for it later on, even
    in parts that have theoretically already been reviewed.

Deal with index entries already in the text, like these:

    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="random-id-UMjE">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c5e1d5" />
      </title>
      <interlinear-gloss>
        <jbo>ta blotrskunri</jbo>
        <gloss>That is-a-(boat)-schooner.</gloss>
<!-- ^^   schooner: example, 83 -->
<indexterm><primary>schooner</primary></indexterm>
        <en>That is a schooner.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>

There are several steps for single-entry situations like this;
multi-entry situations are something else again.

1.  Add a <secondary> tag as appropriate.  In this case, "example".

2.  Move it to somewhere that seems aesthetically pleasing, is
accepted by docbook (try running "make" to check), and is very near
the text in question.  For examples, this is just after the title.
Just inside a <para> (move the actual text after the <indexterm>) is
often a good choice.
  
  YOU MAY NEED A COPY OF THE RED BOOK to do this part effectively,
  because you should be tagging the same bits of text as it is
  (along with others if you wish).

3.  Check, and possibly remove, other instances of the same index
word.

The result here is:

    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="random-id-UMjE">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c5e1d5" />
      </title>
      <indexterm><primary>schooner</primary><secondary>example</secondary></indexterm>
      <interlinear-gloss>
        <jbo>ta blotrskunri</jbo>
        <gloss>That is-a-(boat)-schooner.</gloss>
        <en>That is a schooner.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>

with all other instances removed.  To find them, try:

  grep "<indexterm><primary>schooner<" [0-9]*.xml

or similar.

Please use *exactly* that
<indexterm><primary>[item]</primary><secondary>example</secondary></indexterm>
format for examples, as we might want to automatically munge it
later.

4.  Make sure that all the *other* options listed for the keyword
exist somewhere.  For example, given:

 ------

  DO NOT TOUCH THE INDEX ENTRIES RIGHT NOW.  I think I've found a
  way to automate them.

    YOU CAN SKIP THIS PART; it's easy to check for it later on, even
    in parts that have theoretically already been reviewed.

Multi-entry index situations are a whole different kettle of fish.
Here's an example:

  <!-- ^^   tanru grouping: complex, 87; effect of tanru inversion on, 96; guheks compared with jeks, 350; three-part, 85; with bo, 87; with ke, 88; with ke and bo, 88 -->
  <indexterm><primary>schooner</primary></indexterm>

The problem is that just because the automated inclusion of that
indexterm was inserted in this particular place, which presumably is
near where one of the 7 entries listed there is supposed to actually
point to, that doesn't mean that any of the *other* entries got
inserted in the right place.  That means that

  <!-- ^^   tanru grouping: complex, 87; effect of tanru inversion on, 96; guheks compared with jeks, 350; three-part, 85; with bo, 87; with ke, 88; with ke and bo, 88 -->
  <indexterm><primary>schooner</primary></indexterm>

needs to be turned into *all of*:

  <indexterm><primary>tanru grouping</primary><secondary>complex</secondary></indexterm>

  <indexterm><primary>tanru grouping</primary><secondary>effect of tanru inversion on</secondary></indexterm>

  <indexterm><primary>tanru grouping</primary><secondary>guheks compared with jeks</secondary></indexterm>

  <indexterm><primary>tanru grouping</primary><secondary>three-part</secondary></indexterm>

  <indexterm><primary>tanru grouping</primary><secondary>with bo</secondary></indexterm>

  <indexterm><primary>tanru grouping</primary><secondary>with ke</secondary></indexterm>

  <indexterm><primary>tanru grouping</primary><secondary>with ke and bo</secondary></indexterm>

And each of those needs to be placed in some appropriate place in
the text, where "appropriate" means "in about the same place as it
currently is in the red book", *and* all instances of the original
bits, i.e.:

  <!-- ^^   tanru grouping: complex, 87; effect of tanru inversion on, 96; guheks compared with jeks, 350; three-part, 85; with bo, 87; with ke, 88; with ke and bo, 88 -->
  <indexterm><primary>schooner</primary></indexterm>

need to be removed.

YOU NEED A COPY OF THE RED BOOK to do this part effectively, because
you should be tagging the same bits of text as it is (along with
others if you wish).

 ------

NON-CHAPTER work: Add index entries based on TODO-index.  Pick a
point in the middle somewhere, please, and *especially* for this
work, check in often.

You will almost certainly need a physical copy of the red book to do
this effectively.

There are two kinds of entries in that file:

  animals -- has count 11, skipping --   animals: use of fu'ivla for specific, 61

Means that "animals" had more than 10 matches, so the automatic
marker assumed that there was a problem.

  anomalous ordering of lujvo places -- has count 0, skipping -- anomalous ordering of lujvo places, 283

Means that "anomalous ordering of lujvo places" had 0 matches, so
the automatic marker is sure that there was a problem.

In both cases, the part after the -- is the full index entry from
the original print CLL, and the entry when you're done should look
as close to that as possible (except that : means "the part after
this should go in a <secondary> tag", and obvy the page number won't
match)

You can find the full text of the original index in origcllindex.txt
if you need it.

==================
  Data
==================
- Need some sort of structure for the per-section cmavo lists.
  - also need to wrap the lojban words there in a way that does
    indexing, and ideally auto-generation of the cmavo-per-selmaho
    lists we want for chapter 20
- lojban words, lojban phrases, terms of art ("abstraction"),
  others?... should each have their own index
- cll_chapter5-section1 should be content-words-brivla or so ; those
  IDs should not change when things are moved around
- list the members of each selma'o in chapter 20
- make sure the examples that aren't interlinear glosses don't have
  that as their role
- <phrase role="IPA">∞</phrase> is *not* IPA
- <@xalbo> I do think having distinct structures for quoted correct
  lojban and for intentionally incorrect lojban (if there's any, but
  I would expect there is) would probably be a good thing. <@xalbo>
  (found one: search for djeimz) <@xalbo> I see three cases, though
  I don't know if they're all represented in the text: valid, good
  lojban, invalid lojban, and something in between ({lo nanmu
  bajra}, for instance; maybe worth flagging with a "this isn't what
  you think it is" type of thing
  - use <jbophrase valid="false">...</jbophrase> for na gendra and
    <jbophrase valid="iffy">...</jbophrase> for na smudra
- In the mediaobjects in chapter 1, can we do better than <alt>The
  picture for chapter 20</alt> in terms of non-numerical cross
  referencing?
- It seems that there is a problem with the cmavo lists at the
  beginning of sections having missing entries; in particular, ones
  wwith + in the selma'o, maybe?; they need to be manually checked
- Turn letterals, like <quote>l</quote>, into
  <jbophrase role="letteral">l</jbophrase>
- Turn letteral combinations, like <quote>cx</quote>, into
  <jbophrase role="morphology" valid="false">cx</jbophrase>
- Replace chapter xrefs with section xrefs

==================
  Display
==================
- links to examples should *say* "example N"; easy to test from the
  index
- links to sections should say the number of section and chapter
- examples should be 5.2.1 rather than 5.6 for the first example in
  section 2 of chapter 5
- print: Add a header or footer to the left or the right page that
  has the number of the chapter you're in.

==================
  Both/Other
==================
- make sure backwards-compatible anchors exist
  - Ideally, make sure they are autogenerated as part of the HTML
    production.
- Similarily, generate more-readable anchors based on current
  section number and such
