  <quote>No</quote> Problems: On Lojban Negation</title>
  <section xml:id="cll_chapter15-section1">
    <title>Introductory</title>
    <para>The grammatical expression of negation is a critical part of Lojban's claim to being logical. The problem of negation, simply put, is to come up with a complete definition of the word 
    <quote>not</quote>. For Lojban's unambiguous grammar, this means further that meanings of 
    <quote>not</quote> with different grammatical effect must be different words, and even different grammatical structures.</para>
    <para>Logical assertions are implicitly required in a logical language; thus, an apparatus for expressing them is built into Lojban's logical connectives and other structures.</para>

    <para>In natural languages, especially those of Indo-European grammar, we have sentences composed of two parts which are typically called 
    <quote>subject</quote> and 
    <quote>predicate</quote>. In the statement</para>

    <xref linkend="cll_chapter15-section1-example2" /> says nothing about whether John goes somewhere else, or whether someone else besides John goes to the store.</para>
    <para>We will call this kind of negation 
    <quote>natural language negation</quote>. This kind of negation is difficult to manipulate by the tools of logic, because it doesn't always follow the rules of logic. Logical negation is bi-polar: either a statement is true, or it is false. If a statement is false, then its negation must be true. Such negation is termed contradictory negation.</para>
    <para>Let's look at some examples of how natural language negation can violate the rules of contradictory negation.</para>

    <xref linkend="cll_chapter15-section1-example6" />. Thinking further, we realize that there is an intermediate state wherein I am permitted to go to the dance, but not obligated to do so. Thus, it is possible that both statements are false.</para>
    <para>Sometimes order is significant:</para>

        <jbo>Sam wasn't killed by the falling rock.</jbo>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>Our minds play tricks on us with this one. Because 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter15-section1-example7" /> is written in what is called the 
    <quote>active voice</quote>, we immediately get confused about whether 
    <quote>the falling rock</quote> is a suitable subject for the predicate 
    <quote>did kill Sam</quote>. 
    <quote>Kill</quote> implies volition to us, and rocks do not have volition. This confusion is employed by opponents of gun control who use the argument 
    <quote>Guns don't kill people; people kill people.</quote></para>
    <para>Somehow, we don't have the same problem with 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter15-section1-example8" />. The subject is Sam, and we determine the truth or falsity of the statement by whether he was or wasn't killed by the falling rock.</para>
    <para>
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter15-section1-example8" /> also helps us focus on the fact that there are at least two questionable facts implicit in this sentence: whether Sam was killed, and if so, whether the falling rock killed him. If Sam wasn't killed, the question of what killed him is moot.</para>
    <para>This type of problem becomes more evident when the subject of the sentence turns out not to exist:</para>

    <title>bridi negation</title>
    <para>In discussing Lojban negation, we will call the form of logical negation that simply denies the truth of a statement 
    <quote>bridi negation</quote>. Using bridi negation, we can say the equivalent of 
    <quote>I haven't stopped beating my wife</quote> without implying that I ever started, nor even that I have a wife, meaning simply 
    <quote>It isn't true that I have stopped beating my wife.</quote> Since Lojban uses bridi as smaller components of complex sentences, bridi negation is permitted in these components as well at the sentence level.</para>
    <para>For the bridi negation of a sentence to be true, the sentence being negated must be false. A major use of bridi negation is in making a negative response to a yes/no question; such responses are usually contradictory, denying the truth of the entire sentence. A negative answer to</para>

    <para>The most important rule about bridi negation is that if a bridi is true, its negation is false, and vice versa.</para>
    <para>The simplest way to express a bridi negation is to use the cmavo

    <para>Note that we have used a special convention to show in the English that a bridi negation is present. We would like to use the word 
    <quote>not</quote>, because this highlights the naturalness of putting the negation marker just before the selbri, and makes the form easier to learn. But there is a major difference between Lojban's bridi negation with 
    <quote>na</quote> and natural language negation with 
    <quote>not</quote>. In English, the word 
    <quote>not</quote> can apply to a single word, to a phrase, to an English predicate, or to the entire sentence. In addition, 
    <quote>not</quote> may indicate either contradictory negation or another form of negation, depending on the sentence. Lojban's internal bridi negation, on the other hand, always applies to an entire bridi, and is always a contradictory negation; that is, it contradicts the claim of the whole bridi.</para>

    <para>Because of the ambiguity of English 
    <quote>not</quote>, we will use 
    <quote>[false]</quote> in the translation of Lojban examples to remind the reader that we are expressing a contradictory negation. Here are more examples of bridi negation:</para>

    <para>Negation with 
    <quote>na</quote> applies to an entire bridi, and not to just part of a selbri. Therefore, you won't likely have reason to put 
    <quote>na</quote> inside a tanru. In fact, the grammar currently does not allow you to do so (except in a lujvo and in elaborate constructs involving GUhA, the forethought connector for selbri). Any situation where you might want to do so can be expressed in a less-compressed non-tanru form. This grammatical restriction helps ensure that bridi negation is kept separate from other forms of negation.</para>

    <para>When a selbri is tagged with a tense or a modal, negation with 
    <quote>na</quote> is permitted in two positions: before or after the tag. No semantic difference between these forms has yet been defined, but this is not finally determined, since the interactions between tenses/modals and bridi negation have not been fully explored. In particular, it remains to be seen whether sentences using less familiar tenses, such as:</para>

    <para>What is going on in these statements is something called 
    <quote>scalar negation</quote>. As the name suggests, scalar negation presumes an implied scale. A negation of this type not only states that one scalar value is false, but implies that another value on the scale must be true. This can easily lead to complications. The following exchange seems reasonably natural (a little suspension of disbelief in such inane conversation will help):</para>

    <para>We have acknowledged a scalar negation by providing a correct value which is another color in the set of colors permissible for houses. While a little less likely, the following exchange is also natural:</para>

    <para>we find the result unsettling. This is because it seems that two corrections have been applied when there is only one negation. Yet out of context, 
    <quote>blue house</quote> and

One can devise circumstances where any one, two or all three of these statements might be inferred by a listener.</para>
    <para>In English, we have a clear way of distinguishing scalar negation from predicate negation that can be used in many situations. We can use the partial word 
    <quote>non-</quote> as a prefix. But this is not always considered good usage, even though it would render many statements much clearer. For example, we can clearly distinguish</para>

    <para>We can't always use 
    <quote>non-</quote> though, because of the peculiarities of English's grammar. It would sound strange to say:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-A3yR">

    <para>although these would clarify the vague negation. Another circumlocution for English scalar negation is 
    <quote>other than</quote>, which works where 
    <quote>non-</quote> does not, but is wordier.</para>
    <para>Finally, we have natural language negations that are called polar negations, or opposites:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-XfhT">

        <jbo>John is moral</jbo>
        <jbo>John is immoral</jbo>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>To be immoral is much more than to just be not moral: it implies the opposite condition. Statements like 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter15-section3-example15" /> are strong negations which not only deny the truth of a statement, but assert its opposite. Since, 
    <quote>opposite</quote> implies a scale, polar negations are a special variety of scalar negations.</para>
    <para>To examine this concept more closely, let us draw a linear scale, showing two examples of how the scale is used:</para>
    <cmavo-list>
      <cmavo-entry>
        <cmavo>All Most Some</cmavo>
        <selmaho>Few</selmaho>
        <description>None</description>
      </cmavo-entry>
      <cmavo-entry>
        <cmavo>Excellent Good Fair</cmavo>
        <selmaho>Poor</selmaho>
        <description>Awful</description>
      </cmavo-entry>
    </cmavo-list>
    <para>Some scales are more binary than the examples we diagrammed. Thus we have 
    <quote>not necessary</quote> or 
    <quote>unnecessary</quote> being the polar opposite of necessary. Another scale, especially relevant to Lojban, is interpreted based on situations modified by one's philosophy: 
    <quote>not true</quote> may be equated with 
    <quote>false</quote> in a bi-valued truth-functional logic, while in tri-valued logic an intermediate between 
    <quote>true</quote> and 
    <quote>false</quote> is permitted, and in fuzzy logic a continuous scale exists from true to false. The meaning of 
<!-- ^^   continuous: of tense intervals, 225 -->
<indexterm type="general"><primary>continuous</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>not true</quote> requires a knowledge of which variety of truth scale is being considered.</para>
    <para>We will define the most general form of scalar negation as indicating only that the particular point or value in the scale or range is not valid and that some other (unspecified) point on the scale is correct. This is the intent expressed in most contexts by 
    <quote>not mild</quote>, for example.</para>
    <para>Using this paradigm, contradictory negation is less restrictive than scalar negation - it says that the point or value stated is incorrect (false), and makes no statement about the truth of any other point or value, whether or not on the scale.</para>
    <para>In English, scalar negation semantically includes phrases such as 
    <quote>other than</quote>, 
    <quote>reverse of</quote>, or 
    <quote>opposite from</quote> expressions and their equivalents. More commonly, scalar negation is expressed in English by the prefixes 
    <quote>non-</quote>, 
    <quote>un-</quote>, 
    <quote>il-</quote>, and 
    <quote>im-</quote>. Just which form and permissible values are implied by a scalar negation is dependent on the semantics of the word or concept which is being negated, and on the context. Much confusion in English results from the uncontrolled variations in meaning of these phrases and prefixes.</para>
    <para>In the examples of 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter15-section4" />, we will translate the general case of scalar negation using the general formula 
    <quote>other than</quote> when a phrase is scalar-negated, and 
    <quote>non-</quote> when a single word is scalar-negated.</para>

    <para>but in fact there is no real parallelism at all. A negation using 
    <quote>na</quote> denies the truth of a relationship, but a selbri negation with 
    <quote>na'e</quote> asserts that a relationship exists other than that stated, one which specifically involves the sumti identified in the statement. The grammar allotted to 
    <quote>na'e</quote> allows us to unambiguously express scalar negations in terms of scope, scale, and range within the scale. Before we explain the scalar aspects, let us show how the scope of

    <para>In neither 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter15-section4-example5" /> nor 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter15-section4-example6" /> does the 
    <quote>na'e</quote> negate the entire selbri. While both sentences contain negations that deny a particular relationship between the sumti, they also have a component which makes a positive claim about such a relationship. This is clearer in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter15-section4-example5" />, which says that I am going, but in a non-walking manner. In 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter15-section4-example6" />, we have claimed that the relationship between me and the market in some way involves walking, but is not one of 
    <quote>going to</quote>(perhaps we are walking around the market, or walking-in-place while at the market).</para>
    <para>The 
    <quote>scale</quote>, or actually the 
    <quote>set</quote>, implied in Lojban tanru negations is anything which plausibly can be substituted into the tanru. (Plausibility here is interpreted in the same way that answers to a 
    <quote>mo</quote> question must be plausible - the result must not only have the right number of places and have sumti values appropriate to the place structure, it must also be appropriate or relevant to the context.) This minimal condition allows a speaker to be intentionally vague, while still communicating meaningful information. The speaker who uses selbri negation is denying one relationship, while minimally asserting a different relationship.</para>
    <para>We also need a scalar negation form that has a scope longer than a single brivla. There exists such a longer-scope selbri negation form, as exemplified by (each Lojban sentence in the next several examples is given twice, with parentheses in the second copy showing the scope of the

    <para>The translations show that the negation in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter15-section4-example10" /> is more restricted in scope; i.e. less of the sentence is negated with respect to x1 ( 
    <quote>mi</quote>).</para>
    <para>Logical scope being an important factor in Lojban's claims to be unambiguous, let us indicate the relative precedence of 
    <quote>na'e</quote> as an operator. Grouping with 
    <quote>ke</quote> and 
    <quote>ke'e</quote>, of course, has an overt scope, which is its advantage. 
    <quote>na'e</quote> is very close binding to its brivla. Internal binding of tanru, with 
    <quote>bo</quote>, is not as tightly bound as 
    <quote>na'e</quote>. 
    <quote>co</quote>, the tanru inversion operator has a scope that is longer than all other tanru constructs.</para>
<!-- ^^   tanru inversion, 95; definition, 95; effect on tanru grouping, 96; in complex tanru, 96; multiple, 96; rule for removing, 96; where allowed, 96 -->
<indexterm type="general"><primary>tanru inversion</primary></indexterm>
    <para>In short, 
    <quote>na'e</quote> and 
    <quote>na'eke</quote> define a type of negation, which is shorter in scope than bridi negation, and which affects all or part of a selbri. The result of 
    <quote>na'e</quote> negation remains an assertion of some specific truth and not merely a denial of another claim.</para>
    <para>The similarity becomes striking when it is noticed that the rafsi 
    <quote>-nal-</quote>, representing 
    <quote>na'e</quote> when a tanru is condensed into a lujvo, forms an exact parallel to the English usage of 
    <quote>non-</quote>. Turning a series of related negations into lujvo gives:</para>

    </example>
    <para>Note: 
    <quote>-kem-</quote> is the rafsi for 
    <quote>ke</quote>, but it is omitted in the final lujvo as superfluous - 
    <quote>ke'e</quote> is its own rafsi, and its inclusion in the lujvo implies a 
<!-- ^^   inclusion: property of sets, 125 -->
<indexterm type="general"><primary>inclusion</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>ke</quote> after the 
    <quote>-nal-</quote>, since it needs to close something; only a 
    <quote>ke</quote> immediately after the negation would make the 
    <quote>ke'e</quote> meaningful in the tanru expressed in this lujvo.</para>
    <para>In a lujvo, it is probably clearest to translate 
    <quote>-nal-</quote> as 
    <quote>non-</quote>, to match the English combining forms, except when the 
    <quote>na'e</quote> has single word scope and English uses 
    <quote>un-</quote> or 
    <quote>im-</quote> to negate that single word. Translation style should determine the use of 
    <quote>other than</quote>, 
    <quote>non-</quote>, or another negator for 
    <quote>na'e</quote> in tanru; the translator must render the Lojban into English so it is clear in context. Let's go back to our simplest example:</para>

    </example>
    <para>Note that to compare with the English translation form using 
    <quote>non-</quote>, we've translated the Lojban as if the selbri were a noun. Since Lojban 
    <quote>klama</quote> is indifferently a noun, verb, or adjective, the difference is purely a translation change, not a true change in meaning. The English difference seems significant, though, due to the strongly different English grammatical forms and the ambiguity of English negation.</para>

    <para>Since there is no current King of France, it is false to say that he is bald, or non-bald, or to make any other affirmative claim about him. Any sentence about the current King of France containing only a selbri negation is as false as the sentence without the negation. No amount of selbri negations have any effect on the truth value of the sentence, which is invariably 
    <quote>false</quote>, since no affirmative statement about the current King of France can be true. On the other hand, bridi negation does produce a truth:</para>

    <para>It is not possible to transform sumti negations of either type into bridi negations or scalar selbri negations. Negations of sumti will be used in Lojban conversation.

  <section xml:id="cll_chapter15-section7">
    <title>Negation of minor grammatical constructs</title>
    <para>We have a few other constructs that can be negated, all of them based on negating individual words. For such negation, we use the suffix-combining negator, which is 
    <quote>nai</quote>. 
    <quote>nai</quote>, by the way, is almost always written as a compound into the previous word that it is negating, although it is a regular separate-word cmavo and the sole member of selma'o NAI.</para>
    <para>Most of these negation forms are straightforward, and should be discussed and interpreted in connection with an analysis of the particular construct being negated. Thus, we will not go into much detail here.</para>
    <para>The following are places where 
    <quote>nai</quote> is used:</para>
    <para>When attached to tenses and modals (see 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter10" />), the 
    <quote>nai</quote> suffix usually indicates a contradictory negation of the tagged bridi. Thus 
    <quote>punai</quote> as a tense inflection means 
    <quote>not-in-the-past</quote>, or 
    <quote>not-previously</quote>, without making any implication about any other time period unless explicitly stated. As a result,</para>

    <para>Tenses and modals can be logically connected, with the logical connectives containing contradictory negations; this allows negated tenses and modals to be expressed positively using logical connectives. Thus 
    <quote>punai je ca</quote> means the same thing as 
    <quote>pu naje ca</quote>.</para>
    <para>As a special case, a 
    <quote>-nai</quote> attached to the interval modifiers of selma'o TAhE, ROI, or ZAhO (explained in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter10" />) signals a scalar negation:</para>

      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>means that I dance on the ice either zero or else two or more times within the relevant time interval described by the bridi. 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter15-section7-example3" /> is very different from the English use of 
    <quote>not once</quote>, which is an emphatic way of saying 
    <quote>never</quote>- that is, exactly zero times.</para>
    <para>In indicators and attitudinals of selma'o UI or CAI, 
    <quote>nai</quote> denotes a polar negation. As discussed in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter13" />, most indicators have an implicit scale, and 
    <quote>nai</quote> changes the indicator to refer to the opposite end of the scale. Thus 
    <quote>.uinai</quote> expresses unhappiness, and 
    <quote>.ienai</quote> expresses disagreement (not ambivalence, which is expressed with the neutral or undecided intensity as 
    <quote>.iecu'i</quote>).</para>
    <para>Vocative cmavo of selma'o COI are considered a kind of indicator, but one which identifies the listener. Semantically, we could dispense with about half of the COI selma'o words based on the scalar paradigm. For example, 
<!-- ^^   COI selma'o, 136, 146, 183, 323, 492; effect on pause before name, 323; effect on referent of do, 146; effect on referent of mi, 146; ordering multiple with mi'e, 325; terminator for, 492 -->
<!-- ^^   pause before name: effect of doi, 323; effect of vocatives of COI, 323 -->
<indexterm type="general"><primary>pause before name</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm type="general"><primary>COI selma'o</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>co'o</quote> could be expressed as 
    <quote>coinai</quote>. However, this is not generally done.</para>
    <para>Most of the COI cmavo are used in what are commonly called protocol situations. These protocols are used, for example, in radio conversations, which often take place in a noisy environment. The negatives of protocol words tend to convey diametrically opposite communications situations (as might be expected). Therefore, only one protocol vocative is dependent on 
<!-- ^^   protocol: computer communications using COI, 326; parliamentary using COI, 326; using vocatives, 326 -->
<indexterm type="general"><primary>protocol</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>nai</quote>: negative acknowledgement, which is 
    <quote>je'enai</quote>( 
    <quote>I didn't get that</quote>).</para>
    <para>Unlike the attitudinal indicators, which tend to be unimportant in noisy situations, the protocol vocatives become more important. So if, in a noisy environment, a protocol listener makes out only 
<!-- ^^   protocol: computer communications using COI, 326; parliamentary using COI, 326; using vocatives, 326 -->
<indexterm type="general"><primary>protocol</primary></indexterm>
<!-- ^^   attitudinal indicators, 297; conventions of interpretation, 311; placement of "nai" in, 311; placement of scale in, 311; quick-tour version, 24 -->

    <quote>nai</quote>, he or she can presume it is a negative acknowledgement and repeat transmission or otherwise respond accordingly. 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter13" /> provides more detail on this topic.</para>
    <para>The abstractors of selma'o NU follow the pattern of the tenses and modals. NU allows negative abstractions, especially in compound abstractions connected by logical connectives: 
    <quote>su'ujeninai</quote>, which corresponds to 
    <quote>su'u jenai ni</quote> just as 
    <quote>punai je ca</quote> corresponds to 
    <quote>pu naje ca</quote>. It is not clear how much use logically connected abstractors will be: see 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter13" />.</para>
    <para>A 
    <quote>nai</quote> attached to a non-logical connective (of selma'o JOI or BIhI) is a scalar negation, and says that the bridi is false under the specified mixture, but that another connective is applicable. Non-logical connectives are discussed in

      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>If I never started such a heinous activity, then this sentence is neither true nor false. Such a negation simply says that something is wrong with the non-negated statement. Generally, we then use either tone of voice or else a correction to express a preferred true claim: 
<!-- ^^   tone of voice, 297 -->
<indexterm type="general"><primary>tone of voice</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>I never have beaten my wife.</quote></para>
    <para>Negations which follow such a pattern are called 
    <quote>metalinguistic negations</quote>. In natural languages, the mark of metalinguistic negation is that an indication of a correct statement always, or almost always, follows the negation. Tone of voice or emphasis may be further used to clarify the error.</para>
    <para>Negations of every sort must be expressible in Lojban; errors are inherent to human thought, and are not excluded from the language. When such negations are metalinguistic, we must separate them from logical claims about the truth or falsity of the statement, as well as from scalar negations which may not easily express (or imply) the preferred claim. Because Lojban allows concepts to be so freely combined in tanru, limits on what is plausible or not plausible tend to be harder to determine.</para>
    <para>Mimicking the muddled nature of natural language negation would destroy this separation. Since Lojban does not use tone of voice, we need other means to metalinguistically indicate what is wrong with a statement. When the statement is entirely inappropriate, we need to be able to express metalinguistic negation in a more non-specific fashion.</para>

      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>The set of possible metalinguistic errors is open-ended.</para>
    <para>Many of these forms have a counterpart in the various examples that we've discussed under logical negation. Metalinguistic negation doesn't claim that the sentence is false or true, though. Rather, it claims that, due to some error in the statement, 
    <quote>true</quote> and 
    <quote>false</quote> don't really apply.</para>
    <para>Because one can metalinguistically negate a true statement intending a non-contradictory correction (say, a spelling error); we need a way (or ways) to metalinguistically negate a statement which is independent of our logical negation schemes using 
    <quote>na</quote>, 
    <quote>na'e</quote> and kin. The cmavo 
    <quote>na'i</quote> is assigned this function. If it is present in a statement, it indicates metalinguistically that something in the statement is incorrect. This metalinguistic negation must override any evaluation of the logic of the statement. It is equally allowed in both positive and negative statements.</para>
    <para>Since 
    <quote>na'i</quote> is not a logical operator, multiple occurrences of 
    <quote>na'i</quote> need not be assumed to cancel each other. Indeed, we can use the position of 
    <quote>na'i</quote> to indicate metalinguistically what is incorrect, preparatory to correcting it in a later sentence; for this reason, we give 
    <quote>na'i</quote> the grammar of UI. The inclusion of 
<!-- ^^   inclusion: property of sets, 125 -->
<indexterm type="general"><primary>inclusion</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>na'i</quote> anywhere in a sentence makes it a non-assertion, and suggests one or more pitfalls in assigning a truth value.</para>
    <para>Let us briefly indicate how the above-mentioned metalinguistic errors can be identified. Other metalinguistic problems can then be marked by devising analogies to these examples:</para>
    <para>Existential failure can be marked by attaching 
    <quote>na'i</quote> to the descriptor 
    <quote>lo</quote> or the 
    <quote>poi</quote> in a 
    <quote>da poi</quote>-form sumti. (See Chapter 6 and 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter16" /> for details on these constructions.) Remember that if a 
    <quote>le</quote> sumti seems to refer to a non-existent referent, you may not understand what the speaker has in mind - the appropriate response is then 
    <quote>ki'a</quote>, asking for clarification.</para>
    <para>Presupposition failure can be marked directly if the presupposition is overt; if not, one can insert a 
    <quote>mock presupposition</quote> to question with the sumti tcita (selma'o BAI) word 
    <quote>ji'u</quote>; 
    <quote>ji'uku</quote> thus explicitly refers to an unexpressed assumption, and 
    <quote>ji'una'iku</quote> metalinguistically says that something is wrong with that assumption. (See 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter10" />.)</para>
    <para>Scale errors and category errors can be similarly expressed with selma'o BAI. 
    <quote>le'a</quote> has meaning 
    <quote>of category/class/type X</quote>, 
    <quote>ci'u</quote> has meaning 
<!-- ^^   ci'u, 204 -->
<indexterm type="general"><primary>ci'u</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>on scale X</quote>, and 
    <quote>ci'e</quote>, based on 
    <quote>ciste</quote>, can be used to talk about universes of discourse defined either as systems or sets of components, as shown in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter15-section8" />. 
    <quote>kai</quote> and 
    <quote>la'u</quote> also exist in BAI for discussing other quality and quantity errors.</para>
<!-- ^^   quality and quantity: example, 365 -->
<indexterm type="general"><primary>quality and quantity</primary></indexterm>
    <para>We have to make particular note of potential problems in the areas of undue quantity and incorrect scale/category. Assertions about the relationships between gismu are among the basic substance of the language. It is thus invalid to logically require that if something is blue, that it is colored, or if it is not-blue, then it is some other color. In Lojban, 
    <quote>blanu</quote>( 
    <quote>blue</quote>) is not explicitly defined as a 
    <quote>skari</quote>( 
    <quote>color</quote>). Similarly, it is not implicit that the opposite of 
    <quote>good</quote> is 
    <quote>bad</quote>.</para>
    <para>This mutual independence of gismu is only an ideal. Pragmatically, people will categorize things based on their world-views. We will write dictionary definitions that will relate gismu, unfortunately including some of these world-view assumptions. Lojbanists should try to minimize these assumptions, but this seems a likely area where logical rules will break down (or where Sapir-Whorf effects will be made evident). In terms of negation, however, it is vital that we clearly preserve the capability of denying a presumably obvious scale or category assumption.</para>
<!-- ^^   Sapir-Whorf effects: and emotional indicators, 329 -->
<indexterm type="general"><primary>Sapir-Whorf effects</primary></indexterm>
    <para>Solecisms, grammatical and spelling errors will be marked by marking the offending word or phrase with 
    <quote>na'i</quote>(in the manner of any selma'o UI cmavo). In this sense, 
    <quote>na'i</quote> becomes equivalent to the English metalinguistic marker 
    <quote>[sic]</quote>. Purists may choose to use ZOI or LOhU/LEhU quotes or 
    <quote>sa'a</quote>-marked corrections to avoid repeating a truly unparsable passage, especially if a computer is to analyze the speech/text. See 
<!-- ^^   sa'a, 321, 481; editorial insertion of text already containing sa'a, 321; interaction with li'o, 321; interaction with sei, 321; interaction with to'i, 321 -->
<indexterm type="general"><primary>sa'a</primary></indexterm>
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter19" /> for explanations of these usages.</para>
    <para>In summary, metalinguistic negation will typically take the form of referring to a previous statement and marking it with one or more 
    <quote>na'i</quote> to indicate what metalinguistic errors have been made, and then repeating the statement with corrections. References to previous statements may be full repetitions, or may use members of selma'o GOhA. 
    <quote>na'i</quote> at the beginning of a statement merely says that something is inappropriate about the statement, without specificity.</para>
<!-- ^^   specificity: expressing with po, 173 -->
<indexterm type="general"><primary>specificity</primary></indexterm>
    <para>In normal use, metalinguistic negation requires that a corrected statement follow the negated statement. In Lojban, however, it is possible to completely and unambiguously specify metalinguistic errors without correcting them. It will eventually be seen whether an uncorrected metalinguistic negation remains an acceptable form in Lojban. In such a statement, metalinguistic expression would involve an ellipsis not unlike that of tenseless expression.</para>
<!-- ^^   ellipsis: quick-tour version, 14 -->
<indexterm type="general"><primary>ellipsis</primary></indexterm>
    <para>Note that metalinguistic negation gives us another kind of legitimate negative answer to a

    <quote>xu</quote> question (see 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter15-section8" />). 
    <quote>na'i</quote> will be used when something about the questioned statement is inappropriate, such as in questions like

    <para>One can also specifically qualify the metalinguistic negation, by explicitly repeating the erroneous portion of the bridi to be metalinguistically negated, or adding on of the selma'o BAI qualifiers mentioned above:</para>

    <para>Finally, one may metalinguistically affirm a bridi with

<!-- ^^   jo'a, 321 -->
<indexterm type="general"><primary>jo'a</primary></indexterm>
    <quote>jo'a</quote> might be to affirm that a particular construction, though unusual or counterintuitive, is in fact correct; another usage would be to disagree with - by overriding - a respondent's metalinguistic negation.</para>
