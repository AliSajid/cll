  <title>Chapter 2
A Quick Tour of Lojban Grammar, With Diagrams</title>


<section xml:id="cll_chapter2-section1">
  <title>1. The concept of the bridi</title>
  <para>This chapter gives diagrammed examples of basic Lojban sentence structures. The most general pattern is covered first, followed by successive variations on the basic components of the Lojban sentence. There are many more capabilities not covered in this chapter, but covered in detail in later chapters, so this chapter is a “quick tour” of the material later covered more slowly throughout the book. It also introduces most of the Lojban words used to discuss Lojban grammar.</para>
  <para>Let us consider John and Sam and three statements about them:</para>
  <programlisting><anchor xml:id="c2e1d1"/><anchor xml:id="cll_chapter2-section1-example1"/>1.1)  John is the father of Sam.

<anchor xml:id="c2e1d2"/><anchor xml:id="cll_chapter2-section1-example2"/>1.2)  John hits Sam.

<anchor xml:id="c2e1d3"/><anchor xml:id="cll_chapter2-section1-example3"/>1.3)  John is taller than Sam.
</programlisting>
  <para>These examples all describe relationships between John and Sam. However, in English, we use the noun “father” to describe a static relationship in <xref linkend="cll_chapter2-section1-example1"/>, the verb “hits” to describe an active relationship in <xref linkend="cll_chapter2-section1-example2"/>, and the adjective “taller” to describe an attributive relationship in <xref linkend="cll_chapter2-section1-example3"/>. In Lojban we make no such grammatical distinctions; these three sentences, when expressed in Lojban, are structurally identical. The same part of speech is used to represent the relationship. In formal logic this whole structure is called a “predication”; in Lojban it is called a “bridi”, and the central part of speech is the “selbri”. Logicians refer to the things thus related as “arguments”, while Lojbanists call them “sumti”. These Lojban terms will be used for the rest of the book.</para>

</programlisting>
  <para>In a relationship, there are a definite number of things being related. In English, for example, “give” has three places: the donor, the recipient and the gift. For example:</para>
  <programlisting><anchor xml:id="c2e1d4"/><anchor xml:id="cll_chapter2-section1-example4"/>1.4)  John gives Sam the book.
</programlisting>
  <para>and</para>
  <programlisting><anchor xml:id="c2e1d5"/><anchor xml:id="cll_chapter2-section1-example5"/>1.5)  Sam gives John the book.
</programlisting>
  <para>mean two different things because the relative positions of “John” and “Sam” have been switched. Further,</para>
  <programlisting><anchor xml:id="c2e1d6"/><anchor xml:id="cll_chapter2-section1-example6"/>1.6)  The book gives John Sam.
</programlisting>
  <para>seems strange to us merely because the places are being filled by unorthodox arguments. The relationship expressed by “give” has not changed.</para>
  <para>In Lojban, each selbri has a specified number and type of arguments, known collectively as its “place structure”. The simplest kind of selbri consists of a single root word, called a “gismu”, and the definition in a dictionary gives the place structure explicitly. The primary task of constructing a Lojban sentence, after choosing the relationship itself, is deciding what you will use to fill in the sumti places.</para>
  <para>This book uses the Lojban terms “bridi”, “sumti”, and “selbri”, because it is best to come to understand them independently of the English associations of the corresponding words, which are only roughly similar in meaning anyhow.</para>
  <para>The Lojban examples in this chapter (but not in the rest of the book) use a single underline (---) under each sumti, and a double underline (===) under each selbri, to help you to tell them apart.</para>

<section xml:id="cll_chapter2-section2">
  <title>2. Pronunciation</title>
  <para>Detailed pronunciation and spelling rules are given in <xref linkend="cll_chapter3"/>, but what follows will keep the reader from going too far astray while digesting this chapter.</para>
  <para>Lojban has six recognized vowels: “a”, “e”, “i”, “o”, “u” and “y”. The first five are roughly pronounced as “a” as in “father”, “e” as in “let”, “i” as in “machine”, “o” as in “dome” and “u” as in “flute”. “y” is pronounced as the sound called “schwa”, that is, as the unstressed “a” as in “about” or “around”.</para>
  <para>Twelve consonants in Lojban are pronounced more or less as their counterparts are in English: “b”, “d”, “f”, “k”, “l”, “m”, “n”, “p”, “r”, “t”, “v” and “z”. The letter “c”, on the other hand is pronounced as the “sh” in “hush”, while “j” is its voiced counterpart, the sound of the “s” in “pleasure”. “g” is always pronounced as it is in “gift”, never as in “giant”. “s” is as in “sell”, never as in “rose”. The sound of “x” is not found in English in normal words. It is found as “ch” in Scottish “loch”, as “j” in Spanish “junta”, and as “ch” in German “Bach”; it also appears in the English interjection “yecchh!”. It gets easier to say as you practice it. The letter “r” can be trilled, but doesn’t have to be.</para>
  <para>The Lojban diphthongs “ai”, “ei”, “oi”, and “au” are pronounced much as in the English words “sigh”, “say”, “boy”, and “how”. Other Lojban diphthongs begin with an “i” pronounced like English “y” (for example, “io” is pronounced “yo”) or else with a “u” pronounced like English “w” (for example, “ua” is pronounced “wa”).</para>
  <para>Lojban also has three “semi-letters”: the period, the comma and the apostrophe. The period represents a glottal stop or a pause; it is a required stoppage of the flow of air in the speech stream. The apostrophe sounds just like the English letter “h”. Unlike a regular consonant, it is not found at the beginning or end of a word, nor is it found adjacent to a consonant; it is only found between two vowels. The comma has no sound associated with it, and is used to separate syllables that might ordinarily run together. It is not used in this chapter.</para>
  <para>Stress falls on the next to the last syllable of all words, unless that vowel is “y”, which is never stressed; in such words the third-to-last syllable is stressed. If a word only has one syllable, then that syllable is not stressed.</para>
  <para>All Lojban words are pronounced as they are spelled: there are no silent letters.</para>

<section xml:id="cll_chapter2-section3">
  <title>3. Words that can act as sumti</title>
  <para>Here is a short table of single words used as sumti. This table provides examples only, not the entire set of such words, which may be found in <xref linkend="cll_chapter7"/>.</para>
  <programlisting>
    mi       I/me, we/us
    do      you
    ti      this, these
    ta      that, those
    tu      that far away, those far away
    zo'e    unspecified value (used when a sumti is
            unimportant or obvious)
</programlisting>
  <para>Lojban sumti are not specific as to number (singular or plural), nor gender (masculine/feminine/neutral). Such distinctions can be optionally added by methods that are beyond the scope of this chapter.</para>
  <para>The cmavo “ti”, “ta”, and “tu” refer to whatever the speaker is pointing at, and should not be used to refer to things that cannot in principle be pointed at.</para>
  <para>Names may also be used as sumti, provided they are preceded with the word “la”:</para>
  <programlisting>
   la meris.   the one/ones named Mary
   la djan.    the one/ones named John
</programlisting>
  <para>Other Lojban spelling versions are possible for names from other languages, and there are restrictions on which letters may appear in Lojban names: see <xref linkend="cll_chapter6"/> for more information.</para>

<section xml:id="cll_chapter2-section4">
  <title>4. Some words used to indicate selbri relations</title>
  <para>Here is a short table of some words used as Lojban selbri in this chapter:</para>
  <programlisting>
    vecnu   x1 (seller) sells x2 (goods) to x3 (buyer) for x4 (price)
    tavla   x1 (talker) talks to x2 (audience) about x3 (topic) in language x4
    sutra   x1 (agent) is fast at doing x2 (action)
    blari'o x1 (object/light source) is blue-green
    melbi   x1 (object/idea) is beautiful to x2 (observer) by standard x3
    cutci   x1 is a shoe/boot for x2 (foot) made of x3 (material)
    bajra   x1 runs on x2 (surface) using x3 (limbs) in manner x4 (gait)
    klama   x1 goes/comes to x2 (destination) from x3 (origin point) via x4 (route) using
            x5 (means of transportation)
    pluka   x1 pleases/is pleasing to x2 (experiencer) under conditions x3
    gerku   x1 is a dog of breed x2
    kurji   x1 takes care of x2
    kanro   x1 is healthy by standard x2
    stali   x1 stays/remains with x2
    zarci   x1 is a market/store/shop selling x2 (products) operated by x3 (storekeeper)
</programlisting>
  <para>Each selbri (relation) has a specific rule that defines the role of each sumti in the bridi, based on its position. In the table above, that order was expressed by labeling the sumti positions as x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5.</para>
  <para>Like the table in <xref linkend="cll_chapter2-section3"/>, this table is far from complete: in fact, no complete table can exist, because Lojban allows new words to be created (in specified ways) whenever a speaker or writer finds the existing supply of words inadequate. This notion is a basic difference between Lojban (and some other languages such as German and Chinese) and English; in English, most people are very leery of using words that “aren’t in the dictionary”. Lojbanists are encouraged to invent new words; doing so is a major way of participating in the development of the language. <xref linkend="cll_chapter4"/> explains how to make new words, and <xref linkend="cll_chapter12"/> explains how to give them appropriate meanings.</para>

  <para><xref linkend="cll_chapter2-section6-example1"/> through <xref linkend="cll_chapter2-section6-example3"/> mean the same thing. Usually, placing more than one sumti before the selbri is done for style or for emphasis on the sumti that are out-of-place from their normal position.

       It’s beautiful!
</programlisting>
  <para>Omitting the x1 adds emphasis to the selbri relation, which has become first in the sentence. This kind of sentence is termed an observative, because it is often used when someone first observes or takes note of the relationship, and wishes to quickly communicate it to someone else. Commonly understood English observatives include “Smoke!” upon seeing smoke or smelling the odor, or “Car!” to a person crossing the street who might be in danger. Any Lojban selbri can be used as an observative if no sumti appear before the selbri.</para>
  <para>The word “cu” does not occur in an observative; “cu” is a separator, and there must be a sumti before the selbri that needs to be kept separate for “cu” to be used. With no sumti preceding the selbri, “cu” is not permitted. Short words like “cu” which serve grammatical functions are called “cmavo” in Lojban.</para>

</programlisting>
  <para>Note that only the first and third sumti have switched places; the second sumti has remained in the second place.</para>
  <para>The cmavo “ve” and “xe” switch the first and fourth sumti places, and the first and fifth sumti places, respectively. These changes in the order of places are known as “conversions”, and the “se”, “te”, “ve”, and “xe” cmavo are said to convert the selbri.</para>
  <para>More than one of these operators may be used on a given selbri at one time, and in such a case they are evaluated from left to right. However, in practice they are used one at a time, as there are better tools for complex manipulation of the sumti places. See <xref linkend="cll_chapter5"/> for details.</para>
  <para>The effect is similar to what in English is called the “passive voice”. In Lojban, the converted selbri has a new place structure that is renumbered to reflect the place reversal, thus having effects when such a conversion is used in combination with other constructs such as “le selbri [ku]” (see <xref linkend="cll_chapter2-section10"/>).</para>
</section>

<section xml:id="cll_chapter2-section8">
  <title>8. The basic structure of longer utterances</title>
  <para>People don’t always say just one sentence. Lojban has a specific structure for talk or writing that is longer than one sentence. The entirety of a given speech event or written text is called an utterance. The sentences (usually, but not always, bridi) in an utterance are separated by the cmavo “ni'o” and “.i”. These correspond to a brief pause (or nothing at all) in spoken English, and the various punctuation marks like period, question mark, and exclamation mark in written English. These separators prevent the sumti at the beginning of the next sentence from being mistaken for a trailing sumti of the previous sentence.</para>
  <para>The cmavo “ni'o” separates paragraphs (covering different topics of discussion). In a long text or utterance, the topical structure of the text may be indicated by multiple “ni'o”s, with perhaps “ni'oni'oni'o” used to indicate a chapter, “ni'oni'o” to indicate a section, and a single “ni'o” to indicate a subtopic corresponding to a single English paragraph.</para>
  <para>The cmavo “.i” separates sentences. It is sometimes compounded with words that modify the exact meaning (the semantics) of the sentence in the context of the utterance. (The cmavo “xu”, discussed in <xref linkend="cll_chapter2-section15"/>, is one such word — it turns the sentence from a statement to a question about truth.) When more than one person is talking, a new speaker will usually omit the “.i” even though she/he may be continuing on the same topic.</para>
  <para>It is still O.K. for a new speaker to say the “.i” before continuing; indeed, it is encouraged for maximum clarity (since it is possible that the second speaker might merely be adding words onto the end of the first speaker’s sentence). A good translation for “.i” is the “and” used in run-on sentences when people are talking informally: “I did this, and then I did that, and ..., and ...”.</para>

  <title>10. Description sumti</title>
  <para>Often we wish to talk about things other than the speaker, the listener and things we can point to. Let’s say I want to talk about a talker other than “mi”. What I want to talk about would naturally fit into the first place of “tavla”. Lojban, it turns out, has an operator that pulls this first place out of a selbri and converts it to a sumti called a “description sumti”. The description sumti “le tavla ku” means “the talker”, and may be used wherever any sumti may be used.</para>
  <para>For example,</para>
  <programlisting><anchor xml:id="c2e10d1"/><anchor xml:id="cll_chapter2-section10-example1"/>10.1)  <foreignphrase xml:lang="jbo" role="sumti">mi</foreignphrase><foreignphrase xml:lang="jbo" role="selbri">tavla</foreignphrase><foreignphrase xml:lang="jbo" role="sumti">do</foreignphrase><foreignphrase xml:lang="jbo" role="sumti">le tavla ku</foreignphrase></programlisting>
  <para>means the same as</para>

  <para>where “the talker” is presumably someone other than me, though not necessarily.</para>
  <para>Similarly “le sutra tavla ku” is “the fast talker”, and “le sutra te tavla ku” is “the fast subject of talk” or “the subject of fast talk”. Which of these related meanings is understood will depend on the context in which the expression is used. The most plausible interpretation within the context will generally be assumed by a listener to be the intended one.</para>
  <para>In many cases the word “ku” may be omitted. In particular, it is never necessary in a description at the end of a sentence, so:</para>

</programlisting>
  <para>means exactly the same thing as <xref linkend="cll_chapter2-section10-example1"/>.</para>
  <para>There is a problem when we want to say “The fast one is talking.” The “obvious” translation “le sutra tavla” turns out to mean “the fast talker”, and has no selbri at all. To solve this problem we can use the word “cu”, which so far has always been optional, in front of the selbri.</para>
  <para>The word “cu” has no meaning, and exists only to mark the beginning of the selbri within the bridi, separating it from a previous sumti. It comes before any other part of the selbri, including other cmavo like “se” or “te”. Thus:</para>

</programlisting>
  <para>The sumti “le vecnu” contains the selbri “vecnu”, which has the “seller” in the x1 place, and uses it in this sentence to describe a particular “seller” that the speaker has in mind (one that he or she probably expects the listener will also know about). Similarly, the speaker has a particular blue-green thing in mind, which is described using “le” to mark “blari'o”, a selbri whose first sumti is something blue-green.</para>

  <para>“Possession” refers to the concept of specifying an object by saying who it belongs to (or with). A full explanation of Lojban possession is given in <xref linkend="cll_chapter8"/>. A simple means of expressing possession, however, is to place a sumti representing the possessor of an object within the description sumti that refers to the object: specifically, between the “le” and the selbri of the description:</para>

  <para>In Lojban, possession doesn’t necessarily mean ownership: one may “possess” a chair simply by sitting on it, even though it actually belongs to someone else. English uses possession casually in the same way, but also uses it to refer to actual ownership or even more intimate relationships: “my arm” doesn’t mean “some arm I own” but rather “the arm that is part of my body”. Lojban has methods of specifying all these different kinds of possession precisely and easily.</para>

  <para>There are many kinds of questions in Lojban: full explanations appear in <xref linkend="cll_chapter19"/> and in various other chapters throughout the book. In this chapter, we will introduce three kinds: sumti questions, selbri questions, and yes/no questions.</para>
  <para>The cmavo “ma” is used to create a sumti question: it indicates that the speaker wishes to know the sumti which should be placed at the location of the “ma” to make the bridi true. It can be translated as “Who?” or “What?” in most cases, but also serves for “When?”, “Where?”, and “Why?” when used in sumti places that express time, location, or cause. For example:</para>

       John (is talking to you about me).
</programlisting>
  <para>Like “ko”, “ma” can occur in any position where a sumti is allowed, not just in the first position:</para>

       You     talk    to what/whom?
</programlisting>
  <para>A “ma” can also appear in multiple sumti positions in one sentence, in effect asking several questions at once.</para>
  <programlisting><anchor xml:id="c2e15d4"/><anchor xml:id="cll_chapter2-section15-example4"/>15.4)  <foreignphrase xml:lang="jbo" role="sumti">ma</foreignphrase> [cu]  <foreignphrase xml:lang="jbo" role="selbri">tavla</foreignphrase><foreignphrase xml:lang="jbo" role="sumti">ma</foreignphrase>

</programlisting>
  <para>The two separate “ma” positions ask two separate questions, and can therefore be answered with different values in each sumti place.</para>
  <para>The cmavo “mo” is the selbri analogue of “ma”. It asks the respondent to provide a selbri that would be a true relation if inserted in place of the “mo”:</para>

       You     are-what/do-what?
</programlisting>
  <para>A “mo” may be used anywhere a brivla or other selbri might. Keep this in mind for later examples. Unfortunately, by itself, “mo” is a very non-specific question. The response to the question in <xref linkend="cll_chapter2-section15-example5"/> could be:</para>

       I talk.
</programlisting>
  <para>Clearly, “mo” requires some cooperation between the speaker and the respondent to ensure that the right question is being answered. If context doesn’t make the question specific enough, the speaker must ask the question more specifically using a more complex construction such as a tanru (see <xref linkend="cll_chapter2-section9"/>).</para>
  <para>It is perfectly permissible for the respondent to fill in other unspecified places in responding to a “mo” question. Thus, the respondent in <xref linkend="cll_chapter2-section15-example7"/> could have also specified an audience, a topic, and/or a language in the response.</para>
  <para>Finally, we must consider questions that can be answered “Yes” or “No”, such as</para>
  <programlisting><anchor xml:id="c2e15d8"/><anchor xml:id="cll_chapter2-section15-example8"/>15.8)  Are you talking to me?

</programlisting>
  <para>In Lojban we have a word that asks precisely that question in precisely the same way. The cmavo “xu”, when placed in front of a bridi, asks whether that bridi is true as stated. So</para>

</programlisting>
  <para>is the Lojban translation of <xref linkend="cll_chapter2-section15-example8"/>.</para>
  <para>The answer “Yes” may be given by simply restating the bridi without the “xu” question word. Lojban has a shorthand for doing this with the word “go'i”, mentioned in <xref linkend="cll_chapter2-section11"/>. Instead of a negative answer, the bridi may be restated in such a way as to make it true. If this can be done by substituting sumti, it may be done with “go'i” as well. For example:</para>
  <programlisting><anchor xml:id="c2e15d11"/><anchor xml:id="cll_chapter2-section15-example11"/>15.11) xu <foreignphrase xml:lang="jbo" role="sumti">do</foreignphrase><foreignphrase xml:lang="jbo" role="selbri">kanro</foreignphrase>

  <para>A general negative answer may be given by “na go'i”. “na” may be placed before any selbri (but after the “cu”). It is equivalent to stating “It is not true that ...” before the bridi. It does not imply that anything else is true or untrue, only that that specific bridi is not true. More details on negative statements are available in <xref linkend="cll_chapter15"/>.</para>

  <title>16. Indicators</title>
  <para>Different cultures express emotions and attitudes with a variety of intonations and gestures that are not usually included in written language. Some of these are available in some languages as interjections (i.e. Aha!, Oh no!, Ouch!, Aahh!, etc.), but they vary greatly from culture to culture.</para>
  <para>Lojban has a group of cmavo known as “attitudinal indicators” which specifically covers this type of commentary on spoken statements. They are both written and spoken, but require no specific intonation or gestures. Grammatically they are very simple: one or more attitudinals at the beginning of a bridi apply to the entire bridi; anywhere else in the bridi they apply to the word immediately to the left. For example:</para>
  <programlisting><anchor xml:id="c2e16d1"/><anchor xml:id="cll_chapter2-section16-example1"/>16.1)  .ie <foreignphrase xml:lang="jbo" role="sumti">mi</foreignphrase> [cu] <foreignphrase xml:lang="jbo" role="selbri">klama</foreignphrase>
       Agreement! I go.
       Yep! I’ll go.

<anchor xml:id="c2e16d2"/><anchor xml:id="cll_chapter2-section16-example2"/>16.2)  .ei <foreignphrase xml:lang="jbo" role="sumti">mi</foreignphrase> [cu] <foreignphrase xml:lang="jbo" role="selbri">klama</foreignphrase>
       Obligation! I go.
       I should go.

<anchor xml:id="c2e16d3"/><anchor xml:id="cll_chapter2-section16-example3"/>16.3)  <foreignphrase xml:lang="jbo" role="sumti">mi</foreignphrase> [cu] <foreignphrase xml:lang="jbo" role="selbri">klama</foreignphrase><foreignphrase xml:lang="jbo" role="sumti">le melbi .ui [ku]</foreignphrase>
       I go to the beautiful-thing (and I am happy because it is the beautiful
            thing I’m going to).
</programlisting>
  <para>Not all indicators indicate attitudes. Discursives, another group of cmavo with the same grammatical rules as attitudinal indicators, allow free expression of certain kinds of commentary about the main utterances. Using discursives allows a clear separation of these so-called “metalinguistic” features from the underlying statements and logical structure. By comparison, the English words “but” and “also”, which discursively indicate contrast or an added weight of example, are logically equivalent to “and”, which does not have a discursive content. The average English-speaker does not think about, and may not even realize, the paradoxical idea that “but” basically means “and”.</para>

</programlisting>
  <para>Another group of indicators are called “evidentials”. Evidentials show the speaker’s relationship to the statement, specifically how the speaker came to make the statement. These include “za'a” (I directly observe the relationship), “pe'i” (I believe that the relationship holds), “ru'a” (I postulate the relationship), and others. Many American Indian languages use this kind of words.</para>

       John      goes/went/will-go  to-the store
</programlisting>
  <para>serves as a translation of either <xref linkend="cll_chapter2-section17-example1"/> or <xref linkend="cll_chapter2-section17-example2"/>, and of many other possible English sentences as well. It is not marked for tense, and can refer to an event in the past, the present or the future. This rule does not mean that Lojban has no way of representing the time of an event. A close translation of <xref linkend="cll_chapter2-section17-example1"/> would be:</para>
  <programlisting><anchor xml:id="c2e17d4"/><anchor xml:id="cll_chapter2-section17-example4"/>17.4)  <foreignphrase xml:lang="jbo" role="sumti">la djan.</foreignphrase><foreignphrase xml:lang="jbo" role="selbri">pu klama</foreignphrase><foreignphrase xml:lang="jbo" role="sumti">le zarci</foreignphrase>
       John       [past] goes to-the store
</programlisting>
  <para>where the tag “pu” forces the sentence to refer to a time in the past. Similarly,</para>
  <programlisting><anchor xml:id="c2e17d5"/><anchor xml:id="cll_chapter2-section17-example5"/>17.5)  <foreignphrase xml:lang="jbo" role="sumti">la djan.</foreignphrase><foreignphrase xml:lang="jbo" role="selbri">ca klama</foreignphrase><foreignphrase xml:lang="jbo" role="sumti">le zarci</foreignphrase>
       John       [present] goes to-the store
</programlisting>
  <para>necessarily refers to the present, because of the tag “ca”. Tags used in this way always appear at the very beginning of the selbri, just after the “cu”, and they may make a “cu” unnecessary, since tags cannot be absorbed into tanru. Such tags serve as an equivalent to English tenses and adverbs. In Lojban, tense information is completely optional. If unspecified, the appropriate tense is picked up from context.</para>
  <para>Lojban also extends the notion of “tense” to refer not only to time but to space. The following example uses the tag “vu” to specify that the event it describes happens far away from the speaker:</para>
  <programlisting><anchor xml:id="c2e17d6"/><anchor xml:id="cll_chapter2-section17-example6"/>17.6)  <foreignphrase xml:lang="jbo" role="sumti">do</foreignphrase><foreignphrase xml:lang="jbo" role="selbri">vu vecnu</foreignphrase><foreignphrase xml:lang="jbo" role="sumti">zo'e</foreignphrase>
       You yonder sell something-unspecified.
</programlisting>
  <para>In addition, tense tags (either for time or space) can be prefixed to the selbri of a description, producing a tensed sumti:</para>
  <programlisting><anchor xml:id="c2e17d7"/><anchor xml:id="cll_chapter2-section17-example7"/>17.7)  <foreignphrase xml:lang="jbo" role="sumti">le pu bajra [ku]</foreignphrase> cu            <foreignphrase xml:lang="jbo" role="selbri">tavla</foreignphrase>
       The earlier/former/past runner talked/talks.
</programlisting>
  <para>(Since Lojban tense is optional, we don’t know when he or she talks.)</para>
  <para>Tensed sumti with space tags correspond roughly to the English use of “this” or “that” as adjectives, as in the following example, which uses the tag “vi” meaning “nearby”:</para>
  <programlisting><anchor xml:id="c2e17d8"/><anchor xml:id="cll_chapter2-section17-example8"/>17.8)  <foreignphrase xml:lang="jbo" role="sumti">le vi bajra [ku]</foreignphrase>   cu <foreignphrase xml:lang="jbo" role="selbri">tavla</foreignphrase>
       The nearby runner     talks.
       This runner talks.
</programlisting>
  <para>Do not confuse the use of “vi” in <xref linkend="cll_chapter2-section17-example8"/> with the cmavo “ti”, which also means “this”, but in the sense of “this thing”.</para>
  <para>Furthermore, a tense tag can appear both on the selbri and within a description, as in the following example (where “ba” is the tag for future time):</para>
  <programlisting><anchor xml:id="c2e17d9"/><anchor xml:id="cll_chapter2-section17-example9"/>17.9)  <foreignphrase xml:lang="jbo" role="sumti">le vi tavla [ku]</foreignphrase> cu <foreignphrase xml:lang="jbo" role="selbri">ba klama</foreignphrase>
