    <para>Let us think about the problem of communicating what it is that we are pointing at when we are pointing at something. In Lojban, we can refer to what we are pointing at by using the pro-sumti 
    <quote>ti</quote> if it is nearby, or 
    <quote>ta</quote> if it is somewhat further away, or 
    <quote>tu</quote> if it is distant. (Pro-sumti are explained in full in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter7" />.)</para>
    <para>However, even with the assistance of a pointing finger, or pointing lips, or whatever may be appropriate in the local culture, it is often hard for a listener to tell just what is being pointed at. Suppose one is pointing at a person (in particular, in the direction of his or her face), and says:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-QzhK">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c8e1d1" />
      </title>
      <interlinear-gloss>
        <jbo>ti cu barda</jbo>
        <en>This-one is-big.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>What is the referent of 
    <quote>ti</quote>? Is it the person? Or perhaps it is the person's nose? Or even (for 
    <quote>ti</quote> can be plural as well as singular, and mean 
    <!-- ^^   plural: Lojban contrasted with English in necessity of marking, 120; Lojban equivalent of, 443; meaning of le with, 123 -->
    <indexterm type="general">
      <primary>plural</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <quote>these ones</quote> as well as 
    <quote>this one</quote>) the pores on the person's nose?</para>
    <para>To help solve this problem, Lojban uses a construction called a 
    <quote>relative clause</quote>. Relative clauses are usually attached to the end of sumti, but there are other places where they can go as well, as explained later in this chapter. A relative clause begins with a word of selma'o NOI, and ends with the elidable terminator 
    <quote>ku'o</quote> (of selma'o KUhO). As you might suppose, 
    <quote>noi</quote> is a cmavo of selma'o NOI; however, first we will discuss the cmavo 
    <quote>poi</quote>, which also belongs to selma'o NOI.</para>
    <para>In between the 
    <quote>poi</quote> and the 
    <quote>ku'o</quote> appears a full bridi, with the same syntax as any other bridi. Anywhere within the bridi of a relative clause, the pro-sumti 
    <quote>ke'a</quote> (of selma'o KOhA) may be used, and it stands for the sumti to which the relative clause is attached (called the 
    <quote>relativized sumti</quote>). Here are some examples before we go any further:</para>
    <!-- ^^   relativized sumti: definition, 169; in relative clauses within relative clauses, 184 -->

    </example>
    <para>In the literal translations throughout this chapter, the word 
    <quote>IT</quote>, capitalized, is used to represent the cmavo 
    <quote>ke'a</quote>. In each case, it serves to represent the sumti (in 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qLt8" /> through 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qLuj" />, the cmavo 
    <quote>ti</quote>) to which the relative clause is attached.</para>
    <para>Of course, there is no reason why 
    <quote>ke'a</quote> needs to appear in the x1 place of a relative clause bridi; it can appear in any place, or indeed even in a sub-bridi within the relative clause bridi. Here are two more examples:</para>

        <en>That thing that I want to own is a boat.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>In 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qLxF" />, 
    <quote>ke'a</quote> appears in an abstraction clause (abstractions are explained in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter11" />) within a relative clause.</para>
    <para>Like any sumti, 
    <quote>ke'a</quote> can be omitted. The usual presumption in that case is that it then falls into the x1 place:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-sMHH">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c8e1d7" />

        <jbo>ti poi nazbi cu barda</jbo>
        <en>This-thing which is-a-nose is-big.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>almost certainly means the same thing as 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qLtX" />. However, 
    <quote>ke'a</quote> can be omitted if it is clear to the listener that it belongs in some place other than x1:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-cUsJ">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c8e1d8" />
      </title>
      <interlinear-gloss>
        <jbo>tu poi le mlatu pu lacpu cu ratcu</jbo>
        <en>That-distant-thing which the cat [past] drags is-a-rat</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>is equivalent to 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qLuj" />.</para>
    <para>As stated before, 
    <quote>ku'o</quote> is an elidable terminator, and in fact it is almost always elidable. Throughout the rest of this chapter, 
    <quote>ku'o</quote> will not be written in any of the examples unless it is absolutely required: thus, 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qLt8" /> can be written:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-MtNs">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c8e1d9" />
      </title>
      <interlinear-gloss>
        <jbo>ti poi prenu cu barda</jbo>
        <gloss>That which is-a-person is-big.</gloss>
        <en>That person is big.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>without any change in meaning. Note that 
    <quote>poi</quote> is translated 
    <quote>which</quote> rather than 
    <quote>such-that</quote> when 
    <quote>ke'a</quote> has been omitted from the x1 place of the relative clause bridi. The word 
    <quote>which</quote> is used in English to introduce English relative clauses: other words that can be used are 
    <quote>who</quote> and 
    <quote>that</quote>, as in:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-j5ym">

        <jbo>The building that the school was located in is large.</jbo>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>In 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-j5ym" /> the relative clause is 
    <quote>who was going to the store</quote>, and in 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-J9yC" /> it is 
    <quote>that the school was located in</quote>. Sometimes 
    <quote>who</quote>, 
    <quote>which</quote>, and 
    <quote>that</quote> are used in literal translations in this chapter in order to make them read more smoothly.</para>

    <title>Incidental relative clauses</title>

        </indexterm>
      </cmavo-entry>
    </cmavo-list>
    <para>There are two basic kinds of relative clauses: restrictive relative clauses introduced by 
    <!-- ^^   restrictive relative clauses: non-veridical using voi, 177; veridical using poi, 177 -->
    <indexterm type="general">

    </indexterm>
    <quote>poi</quote>, and incidental (sometimes called simply 
    <quote>non-restrictive</quote>) relative clauses introduced by 
    <quote>noi</quote>. The difference between restrictive and incidental relative clauses is that restrictive clauses provide information that is essential to identifying the referent of the sumti to which they are attached, whereas incidental relative clauses provide additional information which is helpful to the listener but is not essential for identifying the referent of the sumti. All of the examples in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter8-section1" /> are restrictive relative clauses: the information in the relative clause is essential to identification. (The title of this chapter, though, uses an incidental relative clause.)</para>

    <indexterm type="general">
      <primary>incidental relative clause</primary>

    <para>Consider the following examples:</para>

        <jbo>le gerku noi blanu cu barda</jbo>
        <gloss>The dog incidentally-which is-blue is-large.</gloss>
        <en>The dog, which is blue, is large.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>In 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qLXK" />, the information conveyed by 
    <quote>poi blanu</quote> is essential to identifying the dog in question: it restricts the possible referents from dogs in general to dogs that are blue. This is why 
    <quote>poi</quote> relative clauses are called restrictive. In 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qLys" />, on the other hand, the dog which is referred to has presumably already been identified clearly, and the relative clause 
    <quote>noi blanu</quote> just provides additional information about it. (If in fact the dog hasn't been identified clearly, then the relative clause does not help identify it further.)</para>
    <para>In English, the distinction between restrictive and incidental relative clauses is expressed in writing by surrounding incidental, but not restrictive, clauses with commas. These commas are functioning as parentheses, because incidental relative clauses are essentially parenthetical. This distinction in punctuation is represented in speech by a difference in tone of voice. In addition, English restrictive relative clauses can be introduced by 
    <!-- ^^   tone of voice, 297 -->
    <indexterm type="general">
      <primary>tone of voice</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <!-- ^^   restrictive relative clauses: non-veridical using voi, 177; veridical using poi, 177 -->
    <indexterm type="general">

    </indexterm>
    <quote>that</quote> as well as 
    <quote>which</quote> and 
    <quote>who</quote>, whereas incidental relative clauses cannot begin with 
    <quote>that</quote>. Lojban, however, always uses the cmavo 
    <quote>poi</quote> and 
    <quote>noi</quote> rather than punctuation or intonation to make the distinction.</para>
    <para>Here are more examples of incidental relative clauses:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-WxJo">

      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>In this example, 
    <quote>mi</quote> is already sufficiently restricted, and the additional information that I am a judge is being provided solely for the listener's edification.</para>

    <para>In

    <para>Here the speaker probably has several cars, and is restricting the referent of the sumti

    <xref linkend="example-random-id-0qU1" /> means much the same as

    <quote>blabi karce</quote>, like all tanru, is somewhat vague: in principle, it might refer to a car which carries white things, or even express some more complicated concept involving whiteness and car-ness; the restrictive relative clause of

    <indexterm type="general">

    <para>There are types of relative clauses (those which have a certain selbri) which are frequently wanted in Lojban, and can be expressed using a shortcut called a relative phrase. Relative phrases are introduced by cmavo of selma'o GOI, and consist of a GOI cmavo followed by a single sumti.</para>
    <para>Here is an example of 
    <quote>pe</quote>, plus an equivalent sentence using a relative clause:</para>

    <para>As a result, the relationship expressed between two sumti by

    <para>The cmavo 
    <quote>po'u</quote> does not represent possession at all, but rather identity. (Note that it means 
    <quote>poi du</quote> and its form was chosen to suggest the relationship.)</para>
    <para>In 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qM8u" />, the use of 
    <quote>po'u</quote> tells us that 
    <quote>le gerku</quote> and 
    <quote>le mi pendo</quote> represent the same thing. Consider the contrast between 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qM8u" /> and:</para>

    <para>The facts of the case are the same, but the listener's knowledge about the situation may not be. In 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qM8u" />, the listener is presumed not to understand which dog is meant by

    <para>
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-wARJ" />, however, assumes that the listener does not know which of the speaker's friends is referred to, and specifies that it is the friend that is the dog (which dog is taken to be obvious). Here is another example of the same contrast:</para>

    <quote>possess</quote> the person! English can't even express this relationship with a possessive -

    <para>It is worth mentioning that English sometimes over-specifies possession from the Lojban point of view (and the point of view of many other languages, including ones closely related to English). The idiomatic English sentence</para>

    <para>Finally, the elidable terminator for GOI cmavo is 
    <quote>ge'u</quote> of selma'o GEhU; it is almost never required. However, if a logical connective immediately follows a sumti modified by a relative phrase, then an explicit 
    <quote>ge'u</quote> is needed to allow the connective to affect the relativized sumti rather than the sumti of the relative phrase. (What about the cmavo after which selma'o GOI is named? It is discussed in

    <indexterm type="general">

        <en>The dog that is white, which my friend owns, is going.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>In 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-Vbm7" />, the restrictive clause 
    <quote>poi blabi</quote> specifies which dog is referred to, but the incidental clause 
    <quote>noi le mi pendo cu ponse</quote> is mere incidental information: the listener is supposed to already have identified the dog from the 
    <quote>poi blabi</quote>. Of course, the meaning (though not necessarily the emphasis) is the same if the incidental clause appears first.</para>
    <para>It is also possible to connect relative phrases with 
    <quote>zi'e</quote>, or a relative phrase with a relative clause:</para>

    <para>Note that if the colloquial translation of

    <quote>My bottle, which is blue, is broken</quote>, then 
    <quote>noi</quote> rather than 
    <quote>poi</quote> would have been correct in the Lojban version, since that version of the English implies that you do not need to know the bottle is blue. As written, 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-36tm" /> suggests that I probably have more than one bottle, and the one in question needs to be picked out as the blue one.</para>

    <title>Relative clauses and descriptors</title>
    <para>So far, this chapter has described the various kinds of relative clauses (including relative phrases). The list is now complete, and the rest of the chapter will be concerned with the syntax of sumti that include relative clauses. So far, all relative clauses have appeared directly after the sumti to which they are attached. This is the most common position (and originally the only one), but a variety of other placements are also possible which produce a variety of semantic effects.</para>
    <para>There are actually three places where a relative clause can be attached to a description sumti: after the descriptor ( 
    <quote>le</quote>, 
    <quote>lo</quote>, or whatever), after the embedded selbri but before the elidable terminator (which is 
    <quote>ku</quote>), and after the 
    <quote>ku</quote>. The relative clauses attached to descriptors that we have seen have occupied the second position. Thus 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-pcvP" />, if written out with all elidable terminators, would appear as:</para>
    <!-- ^^   elidable terminators: list, 486 -->
    <indexterm type="general">
      <primary>elidable terminators</primary>
    </indexterm>

      </title>
      <interlinear-gloss>
        <jbo>le gerku poi blabi ku'o ku cu klama vau</jbo>
        <gloss>The (dog which (is-white) ) goes.</gloss>
        <en>The dog which is white is going.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>Here 
    <quote>ku'o</quote> is the terminator paired with 
    <quote>poi</quote> and 
    <quote>ku</quote> with 
    <quote>le</quote>, and 
    <quote>vau</quote> is the terminator of the whole bridi.</para>
    <para>When a simple descriptor using 
    <quote>le</quote>, like 
    <quote>le gerku</quote>, has a relative clause attached, it is purely a matter of style and emphasis where the relative clause should go. Therefore, the following examples are all equivalent in meaning to 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-UmLX" />:</para>

      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-UmLX" /> will seem most natural to speakers of languages like English, which always puts relative clauses after the noun phrases they are attached to; 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qmCQ" />, on the other hand, may seem more natural to Finnish or Chinese speakers, who put the relative clause first. Note that in 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qmCQ" />, the elidable terminator 
    <quote>ku'o</quote> must appear, or the selbri of the relative clause ( 
    <quote>blabi</quote>) will merge with the selbri of the description ( 
    <quote>gerku</quote>), resulting in an ungrammatical sentence. The purpose of the form appearing in 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qMct" /> will be apparent shortly.</para>
    <para>As is explained in detail in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6" />, two different numbers (known as the 
    <quote>inner quantifier</quote> and the 
    <quote>outer quantifier</quote>) can be attached to a description. The inner quantifier specifies how many things the descriptor refers to: it appears between the descriptor and the description selbri. The outer quantifier appears before the descriptor, and specifies how many of the things referred to by the descriptor are involved in this particular bridi. In the following example,</para>

    <para>As the parentheses show, 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qmDo" /> means that all five of the persons are women, whereas 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qMDQ" /> means that the two who are going to the market are women. How do we remember which is which? If the relative clause comes after the explicit 
    <quote>ku</quote>, as in 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qMDQ" />, then the sumti as a whole is qualified by the relative clause. If there is no 
    <quote>ku</quote>, or if the relative clause comes before an explicit 
    <quote>ku</quote>, then the relative clause is understood to apply to everything which the underlying selbri applies to.</para>
    <para>What about 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qMdb" />? By convention, it means the same as 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qMDQ" />, and it requires no 
    <quote>ku</quote>, but it does typically require a 
    <quote>ku'o</quote> instead. Note that the relative clause comes before the inner quantifier.</para>
    <para>When 
    <quote>le</quote> is the descriptor being used, and the sumti has no explicit outer quantifier, then the outer quantifier is understood to be 
    <quote>ro</quote> (meaning 
    <quote>all</quote>), as is explained in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter6" />. Thus 
    <quote>le gerku</quote> is taken to mean 
    <quote>all of the things I refer to as dogs</quote>, possibly all one of them. In that case, there is no difference between a relative clause after the 
    <quote>ku</quote> or before it. However, if the descriptor is

    <para>Both 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qmDS" /> and

    <quote>lo prenu noi blabi</quote> mean? Well, the default inner quantifier is 
    <quote>ro</quote> (meaning 
    <quote>all</quote>), and the default outer quantifier is 
    <quote>su'o</quote> (meaning 
    <quote>at least one</quote>). Therefore, we must first take all persons, then choose at least one of them. That one or more people will be going.</para>
    <!-- ^^   all persons: example, 398 -->
    <indexterm type="general">
      <primary>all persons</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <para>In 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qmDS" />, the relative clause described the sumti once the outer quantifier was applied: one or more people, who are white, are going. But in 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qmdX" />, the relative clause actually describes the sumti before the outer quantification is applied, so that it ends up meaning 
    <quote>First take all persons - by the way, they're all white</quote>. But not all people are white, so the incidental claim being made here is false.</para>
    <!-- ^^   all persons: example, 398 -->
    <indexterm type="general">
      <primary>all persons</primary>

    <para>The safe strategy, therefore, is to always use 
    <quote>ku</quote> when attaching a 
    <quote>noi</quote> relative clause to a 
    <quote>lo</quote> descriptor. Otherwise we may end up claiming far too much.</para>
    <para>When the descriptor is 
    <quote>la</quote>, indicating that what follows is a selbri used for naming, then the positioning of relative clauses has a different significance. A relative clause inside the

    <quote>ku</quote> is not. Therefore,</para>

    <para>Note the explicit

    <quote>ku</quote>, the most common kind of possessor sumti are pro-sumti, especially personal pro-sumti, which require no elidable terminator. Descriptions are more likely to be attached with relative phrases.</para>

    <para>A possessive sumti may also have regular relative clauses attached to it.

    </example>
    <para>Note that 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qMGj" /> says farewell to something which doesn't really have to be a horse, something that the speaker simply thinks of as being a horse, or even might be something (a person, for example) who is named 
    <quote>Horse</quote>. In a sense, 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qMGj" /> is ambiguous between 
    <quote>co'o le xirma</quote> and 
    <quote>co'o la xirma</quote>, a relatively safe semantic ambiguity, since names are ambiguous in general: saying 
    <quote>George</quote> doesn't distinguish between the possible Georges.</para>
    <para>Similarly, 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qMG8" /> can be thought of as an abbreviation of:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-oWPU">

      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>Syntactically, vocative phrases are a kind of free modifier, and can appear in many places in Lojban text, generally at the beginning or end of some complete construct; or, as in 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qMG8" /> to 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-qmgM" />, as sentences by themselves.</para>
    <para>As can be seen, the form of vocative phrases is similar to that of sumti, and as you might expect, vocative phrases allow relative clauses in various places. In vocative phrases which are simple names (after the vocative words), any relative clauses must come just after the names:</para>

    <xref linkend="example-random-id-xECX" /> suggests that there is some other Frank (perhaps on the Green Team) from whom this Frank, the one the speaker is greeting, must be distinguished.</para>
    <para>A vocative phrase containing a selbri can have relative clauses either before or after the selbri; both forms have the same meaning. Here are some examples:</para>
    <!-- ^^   vocative phrase: as a free modifier, 135; effect of position on meaning, 137; elidable terminator for, 137; explicit quantifiers prohibited on, 136; forms of, 136; implicit descriptor on, 136; implicit quantifiers on, 136; purpose of, 136; relative clauses on, 184; with complete sumti, 136; with sumti without descriptor, 136 -->

  <section xml:id="cll_chapter8-section10">
    <title>Relative clauses within relative clauses</title>
    <para>For the most part, these are straightforward and uncomplicated: a sumti that is part of a relative clause bridi may itself be modified by a relative clause:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-TGiu">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c8e10d1" />
      </title>

        <jbo>le prenu poi zvati le kumfa poi blanu cu masno</jbo>
        <en>The person who is-in the room which is-blue is-slow.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>However, an ambiguity can exist if 
    <quote>ke'a</quote> is used in a relative clause within a relative clause: does it refer to the outermost sumti, or to the sumti within the outer relative clause to which the inner relative clause is attached? The latter. To refer to the former, use a subscript on 
    <quote>ke'a</quote>:</para>
    <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="example-random-id-8RdM">
      <title>
        <anchor xml:id="c8e10d2" />

      <interlinear-gloss>
        <jbo>le prenu poi zvati le kumfa poi ke'axire zbasu ke'a cu masno</jbo>
        <gloss>The person who is-in the room which IT-sub-2 built IT is-slow.</gloss>
        <en>The person who is in the room which he built is slow.</en>
        <!-- ^^   room which he built: example, 184 -->
        <indexterm type="general">
          <primary>room which he built</primary>
        </indexterm>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>Here, the meaning of 
    <quote>IT-sub-2</quote> is that sumti attached to the second relative clause, counting from the innermost, is used. Therefore, 
    <quote>ke'axipa</quote> (IT-sub-1) means the same as plain 
    <!-- ^^   ke'axipa, 184 -->
    <indexterm type="general">
      <primary>ke'axipa</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <quote>ke'a</quote>.</para>
    <para>Alternatively, you can use a prenex (explained in full in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter16" />), which is syntactically a series of sumti followed by the special cmavo 
    <quote>zo'u</quote>, prefixed to the relative clause bridi:</para>

        <en>which (IT = it2 : it1 built it2) is-slow.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-5TuF" /> is more verbose than 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-8RdM" />, but may be clearer, since it explicitly spells out the two 
    <quote>ke'a</quote> cmavo, each on its own level, and assigns them to the assignable cmavo 
    <quote>ko'a</quote> and 
    <quote>ko'e</quote> (explained in Chapter
