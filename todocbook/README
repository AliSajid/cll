Everything here should be moved to other documentation at some point.

In:

  <example role="interlinear-gloss-example" xml:id="random-id-jig0">

the id is a random string to be used for anchors only, i.e. not for
humans.  It should never be changed or removed.  It should follow
the example around forever (unless the example itself is removed, of
course).

This directory is used to turn the old HTML many-files stuff into
dockbook/xml.  It's not ever intended to be re-run once it's all
working properly; the scripts and stuff are still here in case
something is found that's easier to fix in the HTML and propogate
through.

Anyways, that's why these instructions on how to build everything
aren't in a makefile or something.

First pass was done like this:

  superglom.sh

  merge.sh

  xmlto -o html/ html cll.xml 2>&1 | grep -v 'No localization exists for "jbo" or "". Using default "en".'

This resulted in a bunch of files named N.xml, where N is a chapter
number, and cll.xml as the whole, and html/ with the html version
thereof (which also proves that it validates).

For the second pass these files were moved to N.xml.orig.  The .orig
files were tweaked by hand somewhat, but most of the processing was
automatically done by

  massage.sh

and its various sub-scripts.  This did quote handling, turned the
<programlisting> example bits into the real example structure we're
going to use, and gave them random id tags for future use.

massage.sh relies on:

       identity.xsl
       insert_ids.pl
       make_examples.xsl
       massage.sh
       random-ids

There is now a
  
  Makefile 
  
to do all the steps to turn the N.xml files into html/.  There is
actually an extra XSLT preprocessing step now.  The makefile relies
on:

       docbook2html.css
       docbook2html_config.xsl
       docbook2html_preprocess.xsl
       identity.xsl
