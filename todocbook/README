This directory is used to turn the old HTML many-files stuff into
dockbook/xml.  It's not ever intended to be re-run once it's all
working properly; the scripts and stuff are still here in case
something is found that's easier to fix in the HTML and propogate
through.

Anyways, that's why these instructions on how to build everything
aren't in a makefile or something:

  superglom.sh

  merge.sh

  xmlto -o html/ html cll.xml 2>&1 | grep -v 'No localization exists for "jbo" or "". Using default "en".'
