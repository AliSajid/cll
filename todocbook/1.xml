    <title>What is Lojban?</title>
    <para>Lojban (pronounced 
    <quote>LOZH-bahn</quote>) is a constructed language. Previous versions of the language were called 
    <quote>Loglan</quote>by Dr. James Cooke Brown, who founded the Loglan Project and started the development of the language in 1955. The goals for the language were first described in the open literature in the article

    <para>There are thousands of artificial languages (of which Esperanto is the best-known), but Loglan/Lojban has been engineered to make it unique in several ways. The following are the main features of Lojban:</para>

    <title>What is this book?</title>
    <para>This book is what is called a 
    <quote>reference grammar</quote>. It attempts to expound the whole Lojban language, or at least as much of it as is understood at present. Lojban is a rich language with many features, and an attempt has been made to discover the functions of those features. The word 
    <!-- ^^   reference grammar, 3 -->
    <indexterm type="general">
      <primary>reference grammar</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <quote>discover</quote>is used advisedly; Lojban was not 
    <quote>invented</quote>by any one person or committee. Often, grammatical features were introduced into the language long before their usage was fully understood. Sometimes they were introduced for one reason, only to prove more useful for other reasons not recognized at the time.</para>
    <para>By intention, this book is complete in description but not in explanation. For every rule in the formal Lojban grammar (given in 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter21" />), there is a bit of explanation and an example somewhere in the book, and often a great deal more than a bit. In essence, 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter2" />gives a brief overview of the language, 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter21" />gives the formal structure of the language, and the chapters in between put semantic flesh on those formal bones. I hope that eventually more grammatical material founded on (or even correcting) the explanations in this book will become available.</para>
    <para>Nevertheless, the publication of this book is, in one sense, the completion of a long period of language evolution. With the exception of a possible revision of the language that will not even be considered until five years from publication date, and any revisions of this book needed to correct outright errors, the language described in this book will not be changing by deliberate act of its creators any more. Instead, language change will take place in the form of new vocabulary - Lojban does not yet have nearly the vocabulary it needs to be a fully usable language of the modern world, as 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter12" />explains - and through the irregular natural processes of drift and (who knows?) native-speaker evolution. (Teach your children Lojban!) You can learn the language described here with assurance that (unlike previous versions of Lojban and Loglan, as well as most other artificial languages) it will not be subject to further fiddling by language-meisters.</para>
    <para>It is probably worth mentioning that this book was written somewhat piecemeal. Each chapter began life as an explication of a specific Lojban topic; only later did these begin to clump together into a larger structure of words and ideas. Therefore, there are perhaps not as many cross-references as there should be. However, I have attempted to make the index as comprehensive as possible.</para>
    <para>Each chapter has a descriptive title, often involving some play on words; this is an attempt to make the chapters more memorable. The title of 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter1" />(which you are now reading), for example, is an allusion to the book 
    <citation>English As We Speak It In Ireland</citation>, by P. W. Joyce, which is a sort of informal reference grammar of Hiberno-English.

    <para>Each chapter is broken into numbered sections; each section contains a mixture of expository text, numbered examples, and possibly tables.</para>
    <para>The reader will notice a certain similarity in the examples used throughout the book. One chapter after another rings the changes on the self-same sentences:</para>

        <en>I go to the store.</en>
      </interlinear-gloss>
    </example>
    <para>will become wearisomely familiar before 
    <xref linkend="cll_chapter21" />is reached. This method is deliberate; I have tried to use simple and (eventually) familiar examples wherever possible, to avoid obscuring new grammatical points with new vocabulary. Of course, this is not the method of a textbook, but this book is not a textbook (although people have learned Lojban from it and its predecessors). Rather, it is intended both for self-learning (of course, at present would-be Lojban teachers must be self-learners) and to serve as a reference in the usual sense, for looking up obscure points about the language.</para>
    <para>It is useful to talk further about 
    <xref linkend="example-random-id-hrtj" />for what it illustrates about examples in this book. Examples usually occupy three lines. The first of these is in Lojban, the second in a word-by-word literal translation of the Lojban into English, and the third in colloquial English. The second and third lines are sometimes called the 
    <!-- ^^   examples in this book, 4 -->
    <indexterm type="general">
      <primary>examples in this book</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <quote>literal translation</quote>and the 
    <quote>colloquial translation</quote>respectively. Sometimes, when clarity is not sacrificed thereby, one or both are omitted. If there is more than one Lojban sentence, it generally means that they have the same meaning.</para>
    <para>Words are sometimes surrounded by square brackets. In Lojban texts, these enclose optional grammatical particles that may (in the context of the particular example) be either omitted or included. In literal translations, they enclose words that are used as conventional translations of specific Lojban words, but don't have exactly the meanings or uses that the English word would suggest. In

    <indexterm type="general">

    <xref linkend="cll_chapter3" />, square brackets surround phonetic representations in the International Phonetic Alphabet.</para>

    <para>Many of the tables, especially those placed at the head of various sections, are in three columns. The first column contains Lojban words discussed in that section; the second column contains the grammatical category (represented by an UPPER CASE Lojban word) to which the word belongs, and the third column contains a brief English gloss, not necessarily or typically a full explanation. Other tables are explained in context.</para>
    <para>A few Lojban words are used in this book as technical terms. All of these are explained in

    <para>It is necessary to add, alas, that the examples used in this book do not refer to any existing person, place, or institution, and that any such resemblance is entirely coincidental and unintentional, and not intended to give offense.</para>
    <para>When definitions and place structures of gismu, and especially of lujvo, are given in this book, they may differ from those given in the English-Lojban dictionary (which, as of this writing, is not yet published).

    <citation>Loglan 1: A Logical Language</citation>by James Cooke Brown (4th ed. 1989, The Loglan Institute, Gainesville, Florida, U.S.A.) The language described therein is not Lojban, but is very close to it and may be considered an ancestral version. It is regrettably necessary to state that nothing in this book has been approved by Dr. Brown, and that the very existence of Lojban is disapproved of by him.</para>
