          <h3><a id="6" name="6">6. Truth-value abstraction: ``jei''</h3>

    <p>The ``blueness of the picture'' discussed in <a
    href=../5/>Section 5</a> refers to the measurable amount of
    blue pigment (or other source of blueness), not to the degree
    of truth of the claim that blueness is present. That
    abstraction is expressed in Lojban using ``jei'', which is
    closely related semantically to ``ni''. In the simplest cases,
    ``le jei'' produces not a number but a truth value:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="6-1"
name="6-1">6.1)</a>  le jei li re su'i re du li vo [kei]
    the truth-value-of the-number 2 + 2 = the-number 4
    the truth of 2 + 2 being 4
</pre>
    is equivalent to ``truth'', and 
<pre>
<a id="6-2"
name="6-2">6.2)</a>  le jei li re su'i re du li mu [kei]
    the truth-value-of the-number 2 + 2 = the-number 5
    the truth of 2 + 2 being 5
</pre>
    is equivalent to ``falsehood''. 

    <p>However, not everything in life (or even in Lojban) is
    simply true or false. There are shades of gray even in truth
    value, and ``jei'' is Lojban's mechanism for indicating the
    shade of grey intended:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="6-3" name="6-3">6.3)</a>  mi ba jdice le jei
        la djordj. cu zekri gasnu [kei]
    I [future] decide the truth-value of
        (George being-a-(crime doer)).
    I will decide whether George is a criminal.
</pre>
    <a href="#6-3">Example 6.3</a> does not imply that George is,
    or is not, definitely a criminal. Depending on the legal system
    I am using, I may make some intermediate decision. As a result,
    ``jei'' requires an x2 place analogous to that of ``ni'': 

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>x1 is the truth value of (the bridi) under epistemology
      x2</dd>
    </dl>
    Abstractions using ``jei'' are the mechanism for fuzzy logic in
    Lojban; the ``jei'' abstraction refers to a number between 0
    and 1 inclusive (as distinct from ``ni'' abstractions, which
    are often on open-ended scales). The detailed conventions for
    using ``jei'' in fuzzy-logic contexts have not yet been
    established. 

    <p></p>
