    <h3><a id="s14" name="s14">14. Hesitation: Y</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo is discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   .y. Y   hesitation noise
</pre>
    Speakers often need to hesitate to think of what to say next or
    for some extra-linguistic reason. There are two ways to
    hesitate in Lojban: to pause between words (that is, to say
    nothing) or to use the cmavo ``.y.'' (of selma'o Y). This
    resembles in sound the English hesitation noise written ``uh''
    (or ``er''), but differs from it in the requirement for pauses
    before and after. Unlike a long pause, it cannot be mistaken
    for having nothing more to say: it holds the floor for the
    speaker. Since vowel length is not significant in Lojban, the
    ``y'' sound can be dragged out for as long as necessary.
    Furthermore, the sound can be repeated, provided the required
    pauses are respected. 

    <p>Since the hesitation sound in English is outside the formal
    language, English-speakers may question the need for a formal
    cmavo. Speakers of other languages, however, often hesitate by
    saying (or, if necessary, repeating) a word (``este'' in some
    dialects of Spanish, roughly meaning ``that is''), and Lojban's
    audio-visual isomorphism requires a written representation of
    all meaningful spoken behavior. Of course, ``.y.'' has no
    grammatical significance: it can appear anywhere at all in a
    Lojban sentence except in the middle of a word.</p>
