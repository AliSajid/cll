    <h3><a id="s2" name="s2">2. Sentences: I</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
       .i  I   sentence separator
</pre>
    Since Lojban is audio-visually isomorphic, there needs to be a
    spoken and written way of signaling the end of a sentence and
    the start of the following one. In written English, a period
    serves this purpose; in spoken English, a tone contour (rising
    or falling) usually does the job, or sometimes a long pause.
    Lojban uses a single separator: the cmavo ``.i'' (of selma'o
    I): 
<pre>
<a id="e2d1"
name="e2d1">2.1)</a>  mi klama le zarci .i do cadzu le bisli
    I go to-the store.  You walk on-the ice.
</pre>
    The word ``separator'' should be noted. ``.i'' is not normally
    used after the last sentence nor before the first one, although
    both positions are technically grammatical. ``.i'' signals a
    new sentence on the same topic, not necessarily by the same
    speaker. The relationship between the sentences is left vague,
    except in stories, where the relationship usually is temporal,
    and the following sentence states something that happened after
    the previous sentence. 

    <p>Note that although the first letter of an English sentence
    is capitalized, the cmavo ``.i'' is never capitalized. In
    writing, it is appropriate to place extra space before ``.i''
    to make it stand out better for the reader. In some styles of
    Lojban writing that have been used so far, every ``.i'' is
    placed at the beginning of a line, possibly leaving space at
    the end of the previous line.</p>

    <p>An ``.i'' cmavo may or may not be used when the speaker of
    the following sentence is different from the speaker of the
    preceding sentence, depending on whether the sentences are felt
    to be connected or not.</p>

    <p>An ``.i'' cmavo can be compounded with a logical or
    non-logical connective (a jek or joik), a modal or tense
    connective, or both: these constructs are explained in <a
    href="../c9/s1.html">Chapter 9</a>, <a href="chapter10.html">Chapter
    10</a>, and <a href="../c14/s1.html">Chapter 14</a>. In all cases,
    the ``.i'' comes first in the compound. Attitudinals can also
    be attached to an ``.i'' if they are meant to apply to the
    whole sentence: see <a href="../c13/s1.html">Chapter 13</a>.</p>

    <p>There exist a pair of mechanisms for binding a sequence of
    sentences closely together. If the ``.i'' (with or without
    connectives) is followed by ``bo'' (of selma'o BO), then the
    two sentences being separated are understood to be more closely
    grouped than sentences connected by ``.i'' alone.</p>

    <p> Similarly, a group of sentences can be preceded by ``tu'e'' (of
    selma'o TUhE) and followed by ``tu'u'' (of selma'o TUhU) to fuse
    them into a single unit. A common use of ``tu'e ... tu'u'' is to
    group the sentences which compose a poem: the title sentence would
    precede the group, separated from it by ``.i''. Another use might be
    a set of directions, where each numbered direction might be
    surrounded by ``tu'e ... tu'u'' and contain one or more sentences
    separated by ``.i''. Grouping with ``tu'e'' and ``tu'u'' is
    analogous to grouping with ``ke'' and ``ke'e'' to establish the
    scope of logical or non-logical connectives (see <a
    href="../c14/s1.html">Chapter 14</a>).</p>
