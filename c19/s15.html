    <h3><a id="s15" name="s15">15. No more to say: FAhO</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo is discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   fa'o    FAhO    end of text
</pre>
    The cmavo ``fa'o'' (of selma'o FAhO) is the usually omitted
    marker for the end of a text; it can be used in computer
    interaction to indicate the end of input or output, or for
    explicitly giving up the floor during a discussion. It is
    outside the regular grammar, and the machine parser takes it as
    an unconditional signal to stop parsing unless it is quoted
    with ``zo'' or with ``lo'u ... le'u''. In particular, it is not
    used at the end of subordinate texts quoted with ``lu ...
    li'u'' or parenthesized with ``to ... toi''.
