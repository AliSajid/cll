          <h3><a id="s13" name="s13">13. Erasure: SI, SA, SU</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   si  SI  erase word
    sa  SA  erase phrase
    su  SU  erase discourse
</pre>
    The cmavo ``si'' (of selma'o SI) is a metalinguistic operator
    that erases the preceding word, as if it had never been spoken:
    
<pre>
<a id="e13d1" name="e13d1">13.1)</a>    ti gerku si mlatu
    This is-a-dog, er, is-a-cat.
</pre>
    means the same thing as ``ti mlatu''. Multiple ``si'' cmavo in
    succession erase the appropriate number of words: 
<pre>
<a id="e13d2"
name="e13d2">13.2)</a>    ta blanu zdani si si xekri zdani
    That is-a-blue house, er, er, is-a-black house.
</pre>
    In order to erase the word ``zo'', it is necessary to use three
    ``si'' cmavo in a row: 
<pre>
<a id="e13d3"
name="e13d3">13.3)</a>    zo .bab. se cmene zo si si si la bab.
    The-word ``Bob'' is-the-name-of the word ``si'', er, er, Bob.
</pre>

    <p>The first use of ``si'' does not erase anything, but
    completes the ``zo'' quotation. Two more ``si'' cmavo are then
    necessary to erase the first ``si'' and the ``zo''.</p>

    <p>Incorrect names can likewise cause trouble with ``si'':</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e13d4" name="e13d4">13.4)</a>    mi tavla fo la .esperanto
        si si .esperanton.
    I talk in-language that-named ``and'' ``speranto'',
        er, er, Esperanto.
</pre>

    <p>The Lojbanized spelling ``.esperanto'' breaks up, as a
    consequence of the Lojban morphology rules (see <a
    href="../c4/s1.html">Chapter 4</a>) into two Lojban words, the
    cmavo ``.e'' and the undefined fu'ivla ``speranto''. Therefore,
    two ``si'' cmavo are needed to erase them. Of course, ``.e
    speranto'' is not grammatical after ``la'', but recognition of
    ``si'' is done before grammatical analysis.</p>

    <p>Even more messy is the result of an incorrect ``zoi'':</p>
<pre>
<a id="e13d5" name="e13d5">13.5)</a>    mi cusku zoi fy. gy. .fy.
        si si si si zo .djan
    I express [foreign] [quote] ``sy'' [unquote],
        er, er, er, er, ``John''.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e13d5">Example 13.5</a>, the first ``fy'' is
    taken to be the delimiting word. The next word must be
    different from the delimiting word, and ``gy.'', the Lojban
    name for the letter ``g'', was chosen arbitrarily. Then the
    delimiting word must be repeated. For purposes of ``si''
    erasure, the entire quoted text is taken to be a word, so four
    words have been uttered, and four more ``si'' cmavo are needed
    to erase them altogether. Similarly, a stray ``lo'u'' quotation
    mark must be erased with ``fy. le'u si si si'', by completing
    the quotation and then erasing it all with three ``si''
    cmavo.</p>

    <p>What if less than the entire ``zo'' or ``zoi'' construct is
    erased? The result is something which has a loose ``zo'' or
    ``zoi'' in it, without its expected sequels, and which is
    incurably ungrammatical. Thus, to erase just the word quoted by
    ``zo'', it turns out to be necessary to erase the ``zo'' as
    well:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e13d6" name="e13d6">13.6)</a>    mi se cmene zo .djan.
        si si zo .djordj.
    I am-named-by the-word ``John'',
        er, er, the-word ``George''.
</pre>

    <p>The parser will reject ``zo .djan. si .djordj.'', because in
    that context ``djordj.'' is a name (of selma'o CMENE) rather
    than a quoted word.</p>

    <p>Note: The current machine parser does not implement ``si''
    erasure.</p>

    <p>As the above examples plainly show, precise erasures with
    ``si'' can be extremely hard to get right. Therefore, the cmavo
    ``sa'' (of selma'o SA) is provided for erasing more than one
    word. The cmavo following ``sa'' should be the starting marker
    of some grammatical construct. The effect of the ``sa'' is to
    erase back to and including the last starting marker of the
    same kind. For example:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e13d7"
name="e13d7">13.7)</a>    mi viska le sa .i mi cusku zo .djan.
    I see the  ...  I say the-word ``John''.
</pre>

    <p>Since the word following ``sa'' is ``.i'', the sentence
    separator, its effect is to erase the preceding sentence. So <a
    href="#e13d7">Example 13.7</a> is equivalent to:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e13d8" name="e13d8">13.8)</a>    mi cusku zo .djan.
</pre>

    <p>Another example, erasing a partial description rather than a
    partial sentence:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e13d9"
name="e13d9">13.9)</a>    mi viska le blanu zdan. sa le xekri zdani
    I see the blue hou ...  the black house.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e13d9">Example 13.9</a>, ``le blanu zdan.'' is
    ungrammatical, but clearly reflects the speaker's original
    intention to say ``le blanu zdani''. However, the ``zdani'' was
    cut off before the end and changed into a name. The entire
    ungrammatical ``le'' construct is erased and replaced by ``le
    xekri zdani''.</p>

    <p>Note: The current machine parser does not implement ``sa''
    erasure. Getting ``sa'' right is even more difficult (for a
    computer) than getting ``si'' right, as the behavior of ``si''
    is defined in terms of words rather than in terms of
    grammatical constructs (possibly incorrect ones) and words are
    conceptually simpler entities. On the other hand, ``sa'' is
    generally easier for human beings, because the rules for using
    it correctly are less finicky.</p>

    <p>The cmavo ``su'' (of selma'o SU) is yet another
    metalinguistic operator that erases the entire text. However,
    if the text involves multiple speakers, then ``su'' will only
    erase the remarks made by the one who said it, unless that
    speaker has said nothing. Therefore ``susu'' is needed to
    eradicate a whole discussion in conversation.</p>

    <p>Note: The current machine parser does not implement either
    ``su'' or ``susu'' erasure.</p>
