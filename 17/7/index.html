          <h3>7. Punctuation marks</h3>

    <p>Lojban does not have punctuation marks as such: the denpa bu
    and the slaka bu are really a part of the alphabet. Other
    languages, however, use punctuation marks extensively. As yet,
    Lojban does not have any words for these punctuation marks, but
    a mechanism exists for devising them: the cmavo ``lau'' of
    selma'o LAU. ``lau'' must always be followed by a BY word; the
    interpretation of the BY word is changed from a lerfu to a
    punctuation mark. Typically, this BY word would be a name or
    brivla with a ``bu'' suffix.</p>

    <p>Why is ``lau'' necessary at all? Why not just use a
    ``bu''-marked word and announce that it is always to be
    interpreted as a punctuation mark? Primarily to avoid
    ambiguity. The ``bu'' mechanism is extremely open-ended, and it
    is easy for Lojban users to make up ``bu'' words without
    bothering to explain what they mean. Using the ``lau'' cmavo
    flags at least the most important of such nonce lerfu words as
    having a special function: punctuation. (Exactly the same
    argument applies to the use of ``zai'' to signal an alphabet
    shift or ``ce'a'' to signal a font shift.)</p>

    <p>Since different alphabets require different punctuation
    marks, the interpretation of a ``lau''-marked lerfu word is
    affected by the current alphabet shift and the current font
    shift.</p>
