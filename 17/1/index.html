      <h2>Chapter 17<br />
      As Easy As A-B-C? The Lojban Letteral System And Its Uses</h2>

          <h3>1. What’s a letteral, anyway?</h3>

    <p>James Cooke Brown, the founder of the Loglan Project, coined
    the word “letteral” (by analogy with “numeral”) to mean a
    letter of the alphabet, such as “f” or “z”. A typical
    example of its use might be</p>

<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">1.1)</a>   There are fourteen occurrences of the letteral “e” in this sentence.
</pre>

    (Don’t forget the one within quotation marks.) Using the word
    “letteral” avoids confusion with “letter”, the kind you
    write to someone. Not surprisingly, there is a Lojban gismu for
    “letteral”, namely “lerfu”, and this word will be used in
    the rest of this chapter.</p>

    <p>Lojban uses the Latin alphabet, just as English does, right?
    Then why is there a need for a chapter like this? After all,
    everyone who can read it already knows the alphabet. The answer
    is twofold:</p>

    <p>First, in English there are a set of words that correspond
    to and represent the English lerfu. These words are rarely
    written down in English and have no standard spellings, but if
    you pronounce the English alphabet to yourself you will hear
    them: ay, bee, cee, dee ... . They are used in spelling out
    words and in pronouncing most acronyms. The Lojban equivalents
    of these words are standardized and must be documented
    somehow.</p>

    <p>Second, English has names only for the lerfu used in writing
    English. (There are also English names for Greek and Hebrew
    lerfu: English-speakers usually refer to the Greek lerfu
    conventionally spelled “phi” as “fye”, whereas “fee”
    would more nearly represent the name used by Greek-speakers.
    Still, not all English-speakers know these English names.)
    Lojban, in order to be culturally neutral, needs a more
    comprehensive system that can handle, at least potentially, all
    of the world’s alphabets and other writing systems.</p>

    <p>Letterals have several uses in Lojban: in forming acronyms
    and abbreviations, as mathematical symbols, and as pro-sumti
    &mdash; the equivalent of English pronouns.</p>

    <p>In earlier writings about Lojban, there has been a tendency
    to use the word “lerfu” for both the letterals themselves and
    for the Lojban words which represent them. In this chapter,
    that tendency will be ruthlessly suppressed, and the term
    “lerfu word” will invariably be used for the latter. The
    Lojban equivalent would be “lerfu valsi” or “lervla”.</p>
