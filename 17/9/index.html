          <h3><a id="9" name="9">9. lerfu words as pro-sumti</h3>

    <p>So far, lerfu words have only appeared in Lojban text when
    spelling out words. There are several other grammatical uses of
    lerfu words within Lojban. In each case, a single lerfu word or
    more than one may be used. Therefore, the term ``lerfu string''
    is introduced: it is short for ``sequence of one or more lerfu
    words''.</p>

    <p>A lerfu string may be used as a pro-sumti (a sumti which
    refers to some previous sumti), just like the pro-sumti
    ``ko'a'', ``ko'e'', and so on:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="9-1" name="9-1">9.1)</a>  .abu prami by.
    A loves B
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#9-1">Example 9.1</a>, ``.abu'' and ``by.''
    represent specific sumti, but which sumti they represent must
    be inferred from context.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, lerfu strings may be assigned by ``goi'', the
    regular pro-sumti assignment cmavo:</p>
<pre>
<a id="9-2"
name="9-2">9.2)</a>  le gerku goi gy. cu xekri .i gy. klama le zdani
    The dog, or G, is black.  G goes to the house.
</pre>
    There is a special rule that sometimes makes lerfu strings more
    advantageous than the regular pro-sumti cmavo. If no assignment
    can be found for a lerfu string (especially a single lerfu
    word), it can be assumed to refer to the most recent sumti
    whose name or description begins in Lojban with that lerfu. So
    <a href="#9-2">Example 9.2</a> can be rephrased: 
<pre>
<a id="9-3"
name="9-3">9.3)</a>  le gerku cu xekri. .i gy. klama le zdani
    The dog is black.  G goes to the house.
</pre>
    (A less literal English translation would use ``D'' for ``dog''
    instead.) 

    <p>Here is an example using two names and longer lerfu
    strings:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="9-4" name="9-4">9.4)</a>  la stivn. mark. djonz. merko
        .i la .aleksandr. paliitc. kuzNIETsyf. rusko
        .i symyjy. tavla .abupyky. bau la lojban.
    Steven Mark Jones is-American.
        Alexander Pavlovitch Kuznetsov is-Russian.
        SMJ talks-to APK in Lojban.
</pre>

    <p>Perhaps Alexander's name should be given as ``ru'o.abupyky''
    instead.</p>

    <p>What about</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="9-5" name="9-5">9.5)</a>  .abu dunda by. cy.
    A gives B C
</pre>
    Does this mean that A gives B to C? No. ``by. cy.'' is a single
    lerfu string, although written as two words, and represents a
    single pro-sumti. The true interpretation is that A gives BC to
    someone unspecified. To solve this problem, we need to
    introduce the elidable terminator ``boi'' (of selma'o BOI).
    This cmavo is used to terminate lerfu strings and also strings
    of numerals; it is required when two of these appear in a row,
    as here. (The other reason to use ``boi'' is to attach a free
    modifier --- subscript, parenthesis, or what have you --- to a
    lerfu string.) The correct version is: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="9-6"
name="9-6">9.6)</a>  .abu [boi] dunda by. boi cy. [boi]
    A gives B to C
</pre>
    where the two occurrences of ``boi'' in brackets are elidable,
    but the remaining occurrence is not. Likewise: 
<pre>
<a id="9-7" name="9-7">9.7)</a>  xy. boi ro [boi] prenu cu prami
    X all persons loves.
    X loves everybody.
</pre>
    requires the first ``boi'' to separate the lerfu string ``xy.''
    from the digit string ``ro''.
