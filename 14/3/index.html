          <h3>3. The six types of logical connectives</h3>

    <p>In order to remain unambiguous, Lojban cannot have only a
    single logical connective for each truth function. There are
    many places in the grammar of the language where logical
    connection is permitted, and each must have its appropriate set
    of connectives. If the connective suitable for sumti were used
    to connect selbri, ambiguity would result. Consider the English
    sentence:

<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">3.1)</a>   Mary went to the window and  ... 
</pre>

    where the last word could be followed by “the door”, a noun
    phrase, or by “saw the horses”, a sentence with subject
    omitted, or by “John went to the door”, a full sentence, or
    by one of a variety of other English grammatical constructions.
    Lojban cannot tolerate such grammatical looseness.</p>

    <p>Instead, there are a total of five different selma'o used
    for logical connection: A, GA, GIhA, GUhA, and JA. Each of
    these includes four cmavo, one based on each of the four
    vowels, which is always the last vowel in the cmavo. In selma'o
    A, the vowel is the entire cmavo.</p>

    <p>Thus, in selma'o A, the cmavo for the function <span
    class="c3">A</span> is “a”. (Do not confuse A, which is a
    selma'o, with <span class="c3">A</span>, which is a truth
    function, or “a”, which is a cmavo.) Likewise, the cmavo for
    <span class="c3">E</span> in selma'o GIhA is “gi'e”, and the
    cmavo for <span class="c3">U</span> in selma'o GA is “gu”.
    This systematic regularity makes the cmavo easier to learn.</p>

    <p>Obviously, four cmavo are not enough to express the 14 truth
    functions explained in <a href=../1/>Section 1</a>. Therefore,
    compound cmavo must be used. These compound cmavo follow a
    systematic pattern: each has one cmavo from the five logical
    connection selma'o at its heart, and may also contain one or
    more of the auxiliary cmavo “se”, “na”, or “nai”. Which
    auxiliaries are used with which logical connection cmavo, and
    with what grammar and meaning, will be explained in the
    following sections. The uses of each of these auxiliary cmavo
    relates to its other uses in other parts of Lojban grammar.</p>

    <p>For convenience, each of the types of compound cmavo used
    for logical connection is designated by a Lojban name. The name
    is derived by changing the final “-A” of the selma'o name to
    “-ek”; the reasons for using “-ek” are buried deep in the
    history of the Loglan Project. Thus, compound cmavo based on
    selma'o A are known as eks, and those based on selma'o JA are
    known as jeks. (When writing in English, it is conventional to
    use “eks” as the plural of “ek”.) When the term “logical
    connective” is used in this chapter, it refers to one or more
    of these kinds of compound cmavo.</p>

    <p>Why does the title of this section refer to “six types”
    when there are only five selma'o? A jek may be preceded by
    “.i”, the usual Lojban cmavo for connecting two sentences.
    The compound produced by “.i” followed by a jek is known as
    an ijek. It is useful to think of ijeks as a sixth kind of
    logical connective, parallel to eks, jeks, geks, giheks, and
    guheks.</p>

    <p>There also exist giks, joiks, ijoiks, and joigiks, which are
    not logical connectives but are other kinds of compound cmavo
    which will be introduced later.</p>
