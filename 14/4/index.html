          <h3>4. Logical connection of bridi</h3>

    <p>Now we are ready to express <a href="../1/#Example1">Example 1.1</a>
    in Lojban! The kind of logical connective which is placed
    between two Lojban bridi to connect them logically is an
    ijek:

<pre>
<a id="Example1">4.1)</a>   la djan. nanmu .ija la djeimyz. ninmu
       John is-a-man or James is-a-woman.
</pre>

    Here we have two separate Lojban bridi, “la djan. nanmu”
    and “la djeimyz. ninmu”. These bridi are connected by
    “.ija”, the ijek for the truth function <span
    class="c3">A</span>. The “.i” portion of the ijek tells us
    that we are dealing with separate sentences here. Similarly, we
    can now say:

<pre>
<a id="Example2">4.2)</a>   la djan. nanmu .ije la djeimyz. ninmu
       John is-a-man and James is-a-woman.

<a id="Example3">4.3)</a>   la djan. nanmu .ijo la djeimyz. ninmu
       John is-a-man if-and-only-if James is-a-woman.

<a id="Example4">4.4)</a>   la djan. nanmu .iju la djeimyz. ninmu
       John is-a-man whether-or-not James is-a-woman.
</pre>

    To obtain the other truth tables listed in <a
    href=../2/>Section 2</a>, we need to know how to negate the two
    bridi which represent the component sentences. We could negate
    them directly by inserting “na” before the selbri, but Lojban
    also allows us to place the negation within the connective
    itself.</p>

    <p>To negate the first or left-hand bridi, prefix “na” to the
    JA cmavo but after the “.i”. To negate the second or
    right-hand bridi, suffix “-nai” to the JA cmavo. In either
    case, the negating word is placed on the side of the connective
    that is closest to the bridi being negated.</p>

    <p>So to express the truth table FTTF, which requires <span
    class="c3">O</span> with either of the two bridi negated (not
    both), we can say either:

<pre>
<a id="Example5">4.5)</a>   la djan. nanmu .inajo la djeimyz. ninmu
       John is-not-a-man if-and-only-if James is-a-woman.

<a id="Example6">4.6)</a>   la djan. nanmu .ijonai la djeimyz. ninmu
       John is a man if-and-only-if James is-not-a-woman
</pre>

    The meaning of both <a href="../4/#Example5">Example 4.5</a> and <a
    href="../4/#6">Example 4.6</a> is the same as that of:
    
<pre>
<a id="Example7">4.7)</a>   John is a man or James is a woman, but not both.
</pre>

    Here is another example:

<pre>
<a id="Example8">4.8)</a>   la djan. nanmu .ijanai la djeimyz. ninmu
       John is-a-man or James is-not-a-woman.
       John is a man if James is a woman.
</pre>

    How’s that again? Are those two English sentences in <a
    href="../4/#8">Example 4.8</a> really equivalent? In English, no.
    The Lojban TTFT truth function can be glossed “A if B”, but
    the “if” does not quite have its English sense. <a
    href="../4/#8">Example 4.8</a> is true so long as John is a man,
    even if James is not a woman; likewise, it is true just because
    James is not a woman, regardless of John’s gender. This kind of
    “if-then” is technically known as a “material conditional”.</p>
    

    <p>Since James is not a woman (by our assertions in <a
    href=../1/>Section 1</a>), the English sentence “John is a man
    if James is a woman” seems to be neither true nor false, since
    it assumes something which is not true. It turns out to be most
    convenient to treat this “if” as TTFT, which on investigation
    means that <a href="../4/#Example8">Example 4.8</a> is true. <a
    href="../4/#9">Example 4.9</a>, however, is equally true:

<pre>
<a id="Example9">4.9)</a>   la djan. ninmu .ijanai la djeimyz. ninmu
       John is a woman if James is a woman.
</pre>

    This can be thought of as a principle of consistency, and may
    be paraphrased as follows: “If a false statement is true, any
    statement follows from it.” All uses of English “if” must be
    considered very carefully when translating into Lojban to see
    if they really fit this Lojban mold.</p>

    <a href="../4/#Example10">Example 4.10</a>, which uses the TFTT truth
    function, is subject to the same rules: the stated gloss of TFTT as
    “only if” works naturally only when the left-hand bridi is true;
    if it is false, the right-hand bridi may be either true or false.
    The last gloss of <a href="../4/#Example10">Example 4.10</a> illustrates the
    use of “if ... then” as a more natural substitute for “only
    if”.

<pre>
<a id="Example10">4.10)</a>  la djan. nanmu .inaja la djeimyz. ninmu
       John is-not-a-man or James is-a-woman.
       John is a man only if James is a woman.
       If John is a man, then James is a woman.
</pre>

    The following example illustrates the use of “se” to, in
    effect, exchange the two sentences. The normal use of “se” is
    to (in effect) tranpose places of a bridi, as explained in <a
    href="../../5/1/">Chapter 5</a>. 

<pre>
<a id="Example11">4.11)</a>  la djan. nanmu .iseju la djeimyz. ninmu
       Whether or not John is a man, James is a woman.
</pre>

    If both “na” and “se” are present, which is legal but never
    necessary, “na” would come before “se”. 

    <p>The full syntax of ijeks, therefore, is:

<pre>
       .i [na] [se] JA [nai]
</pre>

    where the cmavo in brackets are optional.</p>
