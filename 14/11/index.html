          <h3>11. Termset logical connection</h3>
    So far we have seen sentences that differ in all components,
    and require bridi connection; sentences that differ in one
    sumti only, and permit sumti connection; and sentences that
    differ in the selbri and possibly one or more sumti, and permit
    bridi-tail connection. Termset logical connectives are employed
    for sentences that differ in more than one sumti but not in the
    selbri, such as: 
<pre>
<a id="11-1"
name="11-1">11.1)</a>    I go to the market from the office
        and to the house from the school.
</pre>
    The Lojban version of <a href="../11/#1">Example 11.1</a>
    requires two termsets joined by a logical connective. A
    “term” is either a sumti or a sumti preceded by a tense or
    modal tag such as “pu” or “bai”. Afterthought termsets are
    formed by linking terms together by inserting the cmavo
    “ce'e” (of selma'o CEhE) between each of them. Furthermore,
    the logical connective (which is a jek) must be prefixed by the
    cmavo “pe'e” (of selma'o PEhE). (We could refer to the
    combination of “pe'e” and a jek as a “pehejek”, I suppose.)
    

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="11-2"
name="11-2">11.2)</a>    mi klama le zarci ce'e le briju pe'e je
        le zdani ce'e le ckule
    I go to-the market [plus] from-the office [joint] and
        to-the house [plus] from-the school.
</pre>

    <p>The literal translation uses “[plus]” to indicate the
    termset connective, and “[joint]” to indicate the position of
    the logical connective joint. As usual, there is an equivalent
    bridi-connection form:</p>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">11.3)</a>    mi klama le zarci le briju
        .ije mi klama le zdani le ckule
    I go to-the market from-the office,
        and I go to-the house from-the school.
</pre>
    which illustrates that the two bridi differ in the x2 and x3
    places only. 

    <p>What happens if the two joined sets of terms are of unequal
    length? Expanding to bridi connection will always make clear
    which term goes in which place of which bridi. It can happen
    that a sumti may fall in the x2 place of one bridi and the x3
    place of another:</p>
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">11.4)</a>    mi pe'e ja do ce'e le zarci
        cu klama le briju
    I [joint] or you to-the market [plus]
        go to/from-the office.
</pre>
    can be clearly understood by expansion to: 
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">11.5)</a>    mi klama le briju
        .ija do le zarci cu klama le briju
    I go to-the office,
        or you to-the market go from-the office.
</pre>
    So “le briju” is your origin but my destination, and thus
    falls in the x2 and x3 places of “klama” simultaneously! This
    is legal because even though there is only one selbri,
    “klama”, there are two distinct bridi expressed here. In
    addition, “mi” in <a href="../11/#4">Example 11.4</a> is
    serving as a termset containing only one term. An analogous
    paradox applies to compound bridi with tail-terms and unequal
    numbers of sumti within the connected bridi-tails: 
<pre>
<a id="11-6"
name="11-6">11.6)</a>     mi klama le zarci gi'e dzukla vau le briju
    I (go to-the market and walk) to/from-the office.
</pre>
    means that I go to the market from the office, and I walk to
    the office; “le briju” is the x3 place of “klama” and the
    x2 place of “dzukla”. 

    <p>Forethought termsets also exist, and use “nu'i” of selma'o
    NUhI to signal the beginning and “nu'u” of selma'o NUhU (an
    elidable terminator) to signal the end. Nothing is inserted
    between the individual terms: they simply sit side-by-side. To
    make a logical connection in a forethought termset, use a gek,
    with the gek just after the “nu'i”, and an extra “nu'u”
    just before the gik:</p>
<pre>
<a id="11-7"
name="11-7">11.7)</a>    mi klama nu'i ge le zarci le briju
        nu'u gi le zdani le ckule [nu'u]
    I go [start termset] both to-the market from-the office
        [joint] and to-the house from-the school
        [end termset].
</pre>

    <p>Note that even though two termsets are being connected, only
    one “nu'i” is used.</p>

    <p>The grammatical uses of termsets that do not contain logical
    connectives are explained in <a href="../../12/1/">Chapter
    12</a> and <a href="../../16/1/">Chapter 16</a>.</p>
