    <h3><a id="s8" name="s8">8. Compound indicators</h3>

    <p>The grammar of indicators is quite simple; almost all facets
    are optional. You can combine indicators in any order, and they
    are still grammatical. The presumed denotation is additive;
    thus the whole is the sum of the parts regardless of the order
    expressed, although the first expressed is presumed most
    important to the speaker. Every possible string of UI cmavo has
    some meaning.</p>

    <p>Within a string of indicators, there will be conventions of
    interpretation which amount to a kind of second-order grammar.
    Each of the modifier words is presumed to modify an indicator
    to the left, if there is one. (There is an ``unspecified
    emotion'' word, ``ge'e'', reserved to ensure that if you want
    to express a modifier without a root emotion, it doesn't attach
    to and modify a previous but distinct emotional
    expression.)</p>

    <p>For example, ``.ieru'e'' expresses a weak positive value on
    the scale of agreement: the speaker agrees (presumably with the
    listener or with something else just stated), but with the
    least possible degree of intensity. But ``.ie ge'eru'e''
    expresses agreement (at an unspecified level), followed by some
    other unstated emotion which is felt at a weak level. A rough
    English equivalent of ``.ie ge'eru'e'' might be ``I agree, but
    ...'' where the ``but'' is left hanging. (Again, attitudes
    aren't always expressed in English by English
    attitudinals.)</p>

    <p>A scale variable similarly modifies the previous emotion
    word. You put the scale word for a root emotion word before a
    modifier, since the latter can have its own scale word. This
    merely maximizes the amount of information expressible. For
    example, ``.oinaicu'i ro'ucai'' expresses a feeling midway
    between pain (``.oi'') and pleasure (``.oinai'') which is
    intensely sexual (``ro'u'') in nature.</p>

    <p>The cmavo ``nai'' is the most tightly bound modifier in the
    language: it always negates exactly one word --- the preceding
    one. Of all the words used in indicator constructs, ``nai'' is
    the only one with any meaning outside the indicator system. If
    you try to put an indicator between a non-indicator cmavo and
    its ``nai'' negator, the ``nai'' will end up negating the last
    word of the indicator. The result, though unambiguous, is not
    what you want. For example,</p>
<pre>
<a id="e8d1" name="e8d1">8.1)</a>  mi .e .ui nai do
    I and [Yay!] [Not!] you
</pre>
    means ``I and (unfortunately) you'', whereas 
<pre>
<a id="e8d2" name="e8d2">8.2)</a>  mi .e nai .ui do
    I and [Not!] [Yay!] you
</pre>
    means ``I but (fortunately) not you''. Attitudinal ``nai''
    expresses a ``scalar negation'', a concept explained in <a
    href="../c15/s1.html">Chapter 15</a>; since every attitudinal word
    implies exactly one scale, the effect of ``nai'' on each should
    be obvious. 

    <p>Thus, the complete internal grammar of UI is as follows,
    with each listed part optionally present or absent without
    affecting grammaticality, though it obviously would affect
    meaning.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>attitudinal ``nai'' intensity-word ``nai'' modifier
      ``nai'' intensity-word ``nai'' (possibly repeated)</dd>
    </dl>
    ``ge'e'', the non-specific emotion word, functions as an
    attitudinal. If multiple attitudes are being expressed at once,
    then in the 2nd or greater position, either ``ge'e'' or a VV
    word must be used to prevent any modifiers from modifying the
    previous attitudinal.
