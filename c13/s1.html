    <h3><a id="s1" name="s1">1. What are attitudinal indicators?</h3>
    This chapter explains the various words that Lojban provides
    for expressing attitude and related notions. In natural
    languages, attitudes are usually expressed by the tone of voice
    when speaking, and (very imperfectly) by punctuation when
    writing. For example, the bare words 
<pre>
<a id="e1d1" name="e1d1">1.1)</a>  John is coming.
</pre>
    can be made, through tone of voice, to express the speaker's
    feeling of happiness, pity, hope, surprise, or disbelief. These
    fine points of tone cannot be expressed in writing. Attitudes
    are also expressed with various sounds which show up in print
    as oddly spelled words, such as the ``Oooh!'', ``Arrgh!'',
    ``Ugh!'', and ``Yecch!'' in the title. These are part of the
    English language; people born to other languages use a
    different set; yet you won't find any of these words in a
    dictionary. 

    <p>In Lojban, everything that can be spoken can also be
    written. Therefore, these tones of voice must be represented by
    explicit words known as ``attitudinal indicators'', or just
    ``attitudinals''. This rule seems awkward and clunky to
    English-speakers at first, but is an essential part of the
    Lojbanic way of doing things.</p>

    <p>The simplest way to use attitudinal indicators is to place
    them at the beginning of a text. In that case, they express the
    speaker's prevailing attitude. Here are some examples,
    correlated with the attitudes mentioned following <a
    href="#e1d1">Example 1.1</a>:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e1d2" name="e1d2">1.2)</a>  .ui la djan klama
    [Whee!] John is coming!
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="e1d3" name="e1d3">1.3)</a>  .uu la djan klama
    [Alas!] John is coming.
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="e1d4" name="e1d4">1.4)</a>  .a'o la djan klama
    [Hopefully] John is coming.
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="e1d5" name="e1d5">1.5)</a>  .ue la djan klama
    [Wow!] John is coming!
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="e1d6" name="e1d6">1.6)</a>  .ianai la djan klama
    [Nonsense!] John is coming.
</pre>
    The primary Lojban attitudinals are all the cmavo of the form
    VV or V'V: one of the few cases where cmavo have been
    classified solely by their form. There are 39 of these cmavo:
    all 25 possible vowel pairs of the form V'V, the four standard
    diphthongs (``.ai'', ``.au'', ``.ei'', and ``.oi''), and the
    ten more diphthongs that are permitted only in these
    attitudinal indicators and in names and borrowings (``.ia'',
    ``.ie'', ``.ii'', ``.io'', ``.iu'', ``.ua'', ``.ue'', ``.ui'',
    ``.uo'', and ``.uu''). Note that each of these cmavo has a
    period before it, marking the pause that is mandatory before
    every word beginning with a vowel. Attitudinals, like most of
    the other kinds of indicators described in this chapter, belong
    to selma'o UI. 

    <p>Attitudinals can also be compound cmavo, of the types
    explained in Sections 4-8; <a href="#e1d6">Example 1.6</a>
    illustrates one such possibility, the compound attitudinal
    ``.ianai''. In attitudinals, ``-nai'' indicates polar negation:
    the opposite of the simple attitudinal without the ``-nai''.
    Thus, as you might suppose, ``.ia'' expresses belief, since
    ``.ianai'' expresses disbelief.</p>

    <p>In addition to the attitudinals, there are other classes of
    indicators: intensity markers, emotion categories, attitudinal
    modifiers, observationals, and discursives. All of them are
    grammatically equivalent, which is why they are treated
    together in this chapter.</p>

    <p>Every indicator behaves in more or less the same way with
    respect to the grammar of the rest of the language. In general,
    one or more indicators can be inserted at the beginning of an
    utterance or after any word. Indicators at the beginning apply
    to the whole utterance; otherwise, they apply to the word that
    they follow. More details can be found in <a href="s9.html">Section
    9</a>.</p>

    <p>Throughout this chapter, tables of indicators will be
    written in four columns. The first column is the cmavo itself.
    The second column is a corresponding English word, not
    necessarily a literal translation. The fourth column represents
    the opposite of the second column, and shows the approximate
    meaning of the attitudinal when suffixed with ``-nai''. The
    third column, which is sometimes omitted, indicates a neutral
    point between the second and fourth columns, and shows the
    approximate meaning of the attitudinal when it is suffixed with
    ``-cu'i''. The cmavo ``cu'i'' belongs to selma'o CAI, and is
    explained more fully in <a href="s4.html">Section 4</a>.</p>

    <p>One flaw that the English glosses are particularly subject
    to is that in English it is often difficult to distinguish
    between expressing your feelings and talking about them,
    particularly with the limited resource of the written word. So
    the gloss for ``.ui'' should not really be ``happiness'' but
    some sound or tone that expresses happiness. However, there
    aren't nearly enough of those that have unambiguous or obvious
    meanings in English to go around for all the many, many
    different emotions Lojban speakers can readily express.</p>

    <p>Many indicators of CV'V form are loosely derived from
    specific gismu. The gismu should be thought of as a memory
    hook, not an equivalent of the cmavo. Such gismu are shown in
    this chapter between square brackets, thus: [gismu].</p>
