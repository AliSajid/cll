    <h3><a id="s4" name="s4">4. Attitudes as scales</h3>

    <p>In Lojban, all emotions and attitudes are scales. These
    scales run from some extreme value (which we'll call
    ``positive'') to an opposite extreme (which we'll call
    ``negative''). In the tables above, we have seen three points
    on the scale: ``positive'', neutral, and ``negative''. The
    terms ``positive'' and ``negative'' are put into scare quotes
    because they are loaded words when applied to emotions, and the
    attitudinal system reflects this loading, which is a known
    cultural bias. Only two of the ``positive'' words, namely
    ``.ii'' (fear) and ``.oi'' (pain/complaint), represent emotions
    commonly thought of as less ``virtuous'' in most cases than
    their negative counterparts. But these two were felt to be
    instinctive, distinct, and very powerful emotions that needed
    to be expressible in a monosyllable when necessary, while their
    counterparts are less commonly expressed.</p>

    <p>(Why the overt bias? Because there are a lot of attitudinals
    and they will be difficult to learn as an entire set. By
    aligning our scales arbitrarily, we give the monosyllable
    ``nai'' a useful meaning and make it easier for a novice to
    recognize at least the positive or negative alignment of an
    indicator, if not the specific word. Other choices considered
    were ``random'' orientation, which would have unknown biases
    and be difficult to learn, and orientation based on our guesses
    as to which scale orientations made the most frequent usages
    shorter, which would be biased in favor of American perceptions
    of ``usefulness''. If bias must exist in our indicator set, it
    might as well be a known bias that eases learning, and in
    addition might as well favor a harmonious and positive
    world-view.)</p>

    <p>In fact, though, each emotional scale has seven positions
    defined, three ``positive'' ones (shown below on the left),
    three ``negative'' ones (shown below on the right), and a
    neutral one indicating that no particular attitude on this
    scale is felt. The following chart indicates the seven
    positions of the scale and the associated cmavo. All of these
    cmavo, except ``nai'', are in selma'o CAI.</p>
<pre>
     cai     sai     ru'e   cu'i   nairu'e naisai  naicai
    [carmi] [tsali] [ruble] [cumki]
</pre>
    A scalar attitude is expressed by using the attitudinal word,
    and then following it by the desired scalar intensity. The bias
    creeps in because the ``negative'' emotions take the extra
    syllable ``nai'' to indicate their negative position on the
    axis, and thus require a bit more effort to express. 

    <p>Much of this system is optional. You can express an attitude
    without a scale indicator, if you don't want to stop and think
    about how strongly you feel. Indeed, for most attitudinals,
    we've found that either no scalar value is used, or ``cai'' is
    used to indicate especially high intensity. Less often,
    ``ru'e'' is used for a recognizably weak intensity, and
    ``cu'i'' is used in response to the attitudinal question
    ``pei'' (see <a href="s10.html">Section 10</a>) to indicate that
    the emotion is not felt.</p>

    <p>The following shows the variations resulting from intensity
    variation:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e4d1" name="e4d1">4.1)</a>  .ei
    I ought to
    (a non-specific obligation)
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="e4d2" name="e4d2">4.2)</a>  .eicai
    I shall/must
    (an intense obligation or requirement, possibly
        a formal one)
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="e4d3" name="e4d3">4.3)</a>  .eisai
    I should
    (a strong obligation or necessity, possibly an
        implied but not formal requirement)
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="e4d4" name="e4d4">4.4)</a>  .eiru'e
    I might
    (a weak obligation --- in English often mixed
        with permission and desire)
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="e4d5" name="e4d5">4.5)</a>  .eicu'i
    No matter
    (no particular obligation)
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="e4d6" name="e4d6">4.6)</a>  .einai
    I need not
    (a non-obligation)
</pre>
    You can also utter a scale indicator without a specific
    emotion. This is often used in the language: in order to
    emphasize a point about which you feel strongly, you mark what
    you are saying with the scale indicator ``cai''. You could also
    indicate that you don't care using ``cu'i'' by itself.
