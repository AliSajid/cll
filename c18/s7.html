    <h3><a id="s7" name="s7">7. Other useful selbri for mekso bridi</h3>

    <p>So far our examples have been isolated mekso (it is legal to
    have a bare mekso as a sentence in Lojban) and equation bridi
    involving ``du''. What about inequalities such as ``x &lt; 5''?
    The answer is to use a bridi with an appropriate selbri,
    thus:</p>

<pre>
<a id="e7d1" name="e7d1">7.1)</a>  li xy. mleca li mu
    the-number x is-less-than the-number 5
</pre>

    <p>Here is a partial list of selbri useful in mathematical
    bridi:</p>
<pre>
   du      x1 is identical to x2, x3, x4, ...
    dunli       x1 is equal/congruent to x2 in/on
            property/quality/dimension/quantity x3
    mleca       x1 is less than x2
    zmadu       x1 is greater than x2
    dubjavme'a  x1 is less than or equal to x2
                [du ja mleca, equal or less]
    dubjavmau   x1 is greater than or equal to x2
                [du ja zmadu, equal or greater]
    tamdu'i     x1 is similar to x2
                [tarmi dunli, shape-equal]
    turdu'i     x1 is isomorphic to x2
                [stura dunli, structure-equal]
    cmima       x1 is a member of set x2
    gripau      x1 is a subset of set x2
                [girzu pagbu, set-part]
    na'ujbi     x1 is approximately equal to
                [namcu jibni, number-near]
    terci'e     x1 is a component with function x2
            of system x3
</pre>
    Note the difference between ``dunli'' and ``du''; ``dunli'' has
    a third place that specifies the kind of equality that is
    meant. ``du'' refers to actual identity, and can have any
    number of places: 

<pre>
<a id="e7d2" name="e7d2">7.2)</a>  py. du xy.boi zy.
    ``p'' is-identical-to ``x'' ``z''
    p = x = z
</pre>

    <p>Lojban bridi can have only one predicate, so the ``du'' is
    not repeated.</p>

    <p>Any of these selbri may usefully be prefixed with ``na'',
    the contradictory negation cmavo, to indicate that the relation
    is false:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e7d3" name="e7d3">7.3)</a>  li re su'i re na du li mu
    the-number 2 + 2 is-not equal-to the-number 5.
    2 + 2 <span class="c3">&frac12;</span><!--notequal--> 5
</pre>

    <p>As usual in Lojban, negated bridi say what is false, and do
    not say anything about what might be true.</p>
