    <p><sub>Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address begins with the
    words ``Four score and seven years ago''. This section exhibits
    several different ways of saying the number ``four score and
    seven''. (A ``score'', for those not familiar with the term, is
    20; it is analogous to a ``dozen'' for 12.) The trivial
    way:</sub></p>
<pre>
<sub><a id="e22d1" name="e22d1">22.1)</a>    bize
    eight seven
    87
</sub>
</pre>
    <sub><a href="#e22d1">Example 22.1</a> is mathematically
    correct, but sacrifices the spirit of the English words, which
    are intended to be complex and formal.</sub>
<pre>
<sub><a id="e22d2" name="e22d2">22.2)</a>    vo pi'i reno su'i ze
    four times twenty plus seven
    4 &times; 20 + 7
</sub>
</pre>
    <sub><a href="#e22d2">Example 22.2</a> is also mathematically
    correct, but still misses something. ``Score'' is not a word
    for 20 in the same way that ``ten'' is a word for 10: it
    contains the implication of 20 objects. The original may be
    taken as short for ``Four score years and seven years ago''.
    Thinking of a score as a twentysome rather than as 20 leads
    to:</sub>
<pre>
<sub><a id="e22d3"
name="e22d3">22.3)</a>    mo'e voboi renomei su'i ze
    the-number-of four twentysomes plus seven
</sub>
</pre>

    <p><sub>In <a href="#e22d3">Example 22.3</a>, ``voboi renomei''
    is a sumti signifying four things each of which are groups of
    twenty; the ``mo'e'' and ``te'u'' then make this sumti into a
    number in order to allow it to be the operand of
    ``su'i''.</sub></p>

    <p><sub>Another approach is to think of ``score'' as setting a
    representation base. There are remnants of base-20 arithmetic
    in some languages, notably French, in which 87 is
    ``quatre-vingt-sept'', literally ``four-twenties-seven''. (This
    fact makes the Gettysburg Address hard to translate into
    French!) If ``score'' is the representation base, then we
    have:</sub></p>
<pre>
<sub><a id="e22d4" name="e22d4">22.4)</a>    vo pi'e ze ju'u reno
    four ; seven base 20
    47<sub>20</sub>
</sub>
</pre>

    <p>Overall, <a href="#e22d3">Example 22.3</a> probably captures
    the flavor of the English best. <a href="#e22d1">Example
    22.1</a> and <a href="#e22d2">Example 22.2</a> are too simple,
    and <a href="#e22d4">Example 22.4</a> is too tricky.
    Nevertheless, all four examples are good Lojban. Pedagogically,
    these examples illustrate the richness of lojbau mekso:
    anything that can be said at all, can probably be said in more
    than one way.</p>
