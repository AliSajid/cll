    <h3><a id="s4" name="s4">4. Special numbers</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
   ci'i    PA  infinity
    ka'o    PA  imaginary i, sqrt(-1)
    pai PA  pi (approx 3.14159...)
    te'o    PA  exponential e (approx 2.71828...)
    fi'u    PA  golden ratio, phi,
            (1 + sqrt(5))/2 (approx. 1.61803...)
</pre>
    The last cmavo is the same as the fraction sign cmavo: a
    fraction sign with neither numerator nor denominator represents
    the golden ratio. 

    <p>Numbers can have any of these digit, punctuation, and
    special-number cmavo of Sections 2, 3, and 4 in any
    combination:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e4d1" name="e4d1">4.1)</a>  ma'u ci'i
    +<span class="c3">&yen;</span><!--infty-->
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="e4d2" name="e4d2">4.2)</a>  ci ka'o re
    3i2 (a complex number equivalent to ``3 + 2i'')
</pre>
    Note that ``ka'o'' is both a special number (meaning ``i'') and
    a number punctuation mark (separating the real and the
    imaginary parts of a complex number). 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e4d3" name="e4d3">4.3)</a>  ci'i no
    infinity zero
    <span class="c3">&Agrave;</span>
<!--aleph--><sub>0</sub> (a transfinite cardinal)
</pre>

    <p>The special numbers ``pai'' and ``te'o'' are mathematically
    important, which is why they are given their own cmavo:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e4d4" name="e4d4">4.4)</a>  pai
    pi

<a id="e4d5" name="e4d5">4.5)</a>   te'o
    e
</pre>
    However, many combinations are as yet undefined: 
<pre>
<a id="e4d6" name="e4d6">4.6)</a>  pa pi re pi ci
    1.2.3

<a id="e4d7" name="e4d7">4.7)</a>   pa ni'u re
    1 negative-sign 2
</pre>
    <a href="#e4d5">Example 4.5</a> is not ``1 minus 2'', which is
    represented by a different cmavo sequence altogether. It is a
    single number which has not been assigned a meaning. There are
    many such numbers which have no well-defined meaning; they may
    be used for experimental purposes or for future expansion of
    the Lojban number system. 

    <p>It is possible, of course, that some of these ``oddities''
    do have a meaningful use in some restricted area of
    mathematics. A mathematician appropriating these structures for
    specialized use needs to consider whether some other branch of
    mathematics would use the structure differently.</p>
