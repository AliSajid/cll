    <h3><a id="s12" name="s12">12. Number questions</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo is discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   xo  PA  number question
</pre>
    The cmavo ``xo'', a member of selma'o PA, is used to ask
    questions whose answers are numbers. Like most Lojban question
    words, it fills the blank where the answer should go. (See <a
    href="../c19/s1.html">Chapter 19</a> for more on Lojban
    questions.) 
<pre>
<a id="e12d1" name="e12d1">12.1)</a>    li re su'i re du li xo
    the-number 2 plus 2 equals the-number what?
    What is 2 + 2?
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="e12d2" name="e12d2">12.2)</a>    le xomoi prenu cu darxi do
    the what-number-th person hit you?
    Which person [as in a police lineup] hit you?
</pre>
    ``xo'' can also be combined with other digits to ask questions
    whose answers are already partly specified. This ability could
    be very useful in writing tests of elementary arithmetical
    knowledge: 
<pre>
<a id="e12d3"
name="e12d3">12.3)</a>    li remu pi'i xa du li paxono
    the-number 25 times 6 equals the-number 1?0
</pre>
    to which the correct reply would be ``mu'', or 5. The ability
    to utter bare numbers as grammatical Lojban sentences is
    primarily intended for giving answers to ``xo'' questions.
    (Another use, obviously, is for counting off physical objects
    one by one.)
