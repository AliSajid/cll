    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
   pa  PA  1
    re  PA  2
    ci  PA  3
    vo  PA  4
    mu  PA  5
    xa  PA  6
    ze  PA  7
    bi  PA  8
    so  PA  9
    no  PA  0           
</pre>
    The simplest kind of mekso are numbers, which are cmavo or
    compound cmavo. There are cmavo for each of the 10 decimal
    digits, and numbers greater than 9 are made by stringing
    together the cmavo. Some examples: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e2d1" name="e2d1">2.1)</a>  pa re ci
    one two three
    123
    one hundred and twenty three

<a id="e2d2" name="e2d2">2.2)</a>   pa no
    one zero
    10
    ten

<a id="e2d3" name="e2d3">2.3)</a>   pa re ci vo mu xa ze bi so no
    one two three four five six seven eight nine zero
    1234567890
    one billion, two hundred and thirty-four million,
        five hundred and sixty-seven thousand,
        eight hundred and ninety.
</pre>
    Therefore, there are no separate cmavo for ``ten'',
    ``hundred'', etc. 

    <p>There is a pattern to the digit cmavo (except for ``no'', 0)
    which is worth explaining. The cmavo from 1 to 5 end in the
    vowels ``a'', ``e'', ``i'', ``o'', ``u'' respectively; and the
    cmavo from 6 to 9 likewise end in the vowels ``a'', ``e'',
    ``i'', and ``o'' respectively. None of the digit cmavo begin
    with the same consonant, to make them easy to tell apart in
    noisy environments.</p>
