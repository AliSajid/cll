          <h3><a id="s6" name="s6">6. Accent marks and compound lerfu words</h3>

    <p>Many languages that make use of the Latin alphabet add
    special marks to some of the lerfu they use. French, for
    example, uses three accent marks above vowels, called (in
    English) ``acute'', ``grave'', and ``circumflex''. Likewise,
    German uses a mark called ``umlaut''; a mark which looks the
    same is also used in French, but with a different name and
    meaning.</p>

    <p>These marks may be considered lerfu, and each has a
    corresponding lerfu word in Lojban. So far, no problem. But the
    marks appear over lerfu, whereas the words must be spoken (or
    written) either before or after the lerfu word representing the
    basic lerfu. Typewriters (for mechanical reasons) and the
    computer programs that emulate them usually require their users
    to type the accent mark before the basic lerfu, whereas in
    speech the accent mark is often pronounced afterwards (for
    example, in German ``a umlaut'' is preferred to ``umlaut
    a'').</p>

    <p> Lojban cannot settle this question by fiat. Either it must be
    left up to default interpretation depending on the language in
    question, or the lerfu-word compounding cmavo ``tei'' (of selma'o
    TEI) and ``foi'' (of selma'o FOI) must be used. These cmavo are
    always used in pairs; any number of lerfu words may appear between
    them, and the whole is treated as a single compound lerfu word. The
    French word ``&eacute;t&eacute;'', with acute accent marks on both
    ``e'' lerfu, could be spelled as:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e6d1"
name="e6d1">6.1)</a>  tei .ebu .akut. bu foi ty. tei .akut. bu .ebu foi
    ( ``e'' acute ) ``t'' ( acute ``e'' )
</pre>
    and it does not matter whether ``akut. bu''
    appears before or after ``.ebu''; the ``tei ... foi'' grouping
    guarantees that the acute accent is associated with the correct
    lerfu. Of course, the level of precision represented by <a
    href="#e6d1">Example 6.1</a> would rarely be required: it might
    be needed by a Lojban-speaker when spelling out a French word
    for exact transcription by another Lojban-speaker who did not
    know French. 

    <p>This system breaks down in languages which use more than one
    accent mark on a single lerfu; some other convention must be
    used for showing which accent marks are written where in that
    case. The obvious convention is to represent the mark nearest
    the basic lerfu by the lerfu word closest to the word
    representing the basic lerfu. Any remaining ambiguities must be
    resolved by further conventions not yet established.</p>

    <p>Some languages, like Swedish and Finnish, consider certain
    accented lerfu to be completely distinct from their unaccented
    equivalents, but Lojban does not make a formal distinction,
    since the printed characters look the same whether they are
    reckoned as separate letters or not. In addition, some
    languages consider certain 2-letter combinations (like ``ll''
    and ``ch'' in Spanish) to be letters; this may be represented
    by enclosing the combination in ``tei ... foi''.</p>

    <p>In addition, when discussing a specific language, it is
    permissible to make up new lerfu words, as long as they are
    either explained locally or well understood from context: thus
    Spanish ``ll'' or Croatian ``lj'' could be called ``libu'', but
    that usage would not necessarily be universally understood.</p>

    lerfu words for some common accent marks.</p>
