    <h3><a id="s13" name="s13">13. Computerized character codes</h3>

    <p>Since the first application of computers to non-numerical
    information, character sets have existed, mapping numbers
    (called ``character codes'') into selected lerfu, digits, and
    punctuation marks (collectively called ``characters'').
    Historically, these character sets have only covered the
    English alphabet and a few selected punctuation marks.
    International efforts are now underway to create a unified
    character set that can represent essentially all the characters
    in essentially all the world's writing systems. Lojban can take
    advantage of these encoding schemes by using the cmavo ``se'e''
    (of selma'o BY). This cmavo is conventionally followed by digit
    cmavo of selma'o PA representing the character code, and the
    whole string indicates a single character in some computerized
    character set:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e13d1" name="e13d1">13.1)</a>    me'o se'ecixa cu lerfu
        la .asycy'i'is. loi merko rupnu
    the-expression [code] 36 is-a-letteral
        in-set ASCII
        for-the-mass-of American currency-units.
    The character code 36 in ASCII represents
        American dollars.
    ``&amp;dollar;'' represents American dollars.
</pre>
    Understanding <a href="#e13d1">Example 13.1</a> depends on
    knowing the value in the ASCII character set (one of the
    simplest and oldest) of the ``&amp;dollar;'' character.
    Therefore, the ``se'e'' convention is only intelligible to
    those who know the underlying character set. For precisely
    specifying a particular character, however, it has the
    advantages of unambiguity and (relative) cultural neutrality,
    and therefore Lojban provides a means for those with access to
    descriptions of such character sets to take advantage of them. 

    <p>As another example, the Unicode character set (also known as
    ISO 10646) represents the international symbol of peace, an
    inverted trident in a circle, using the base-16 value 262E. In
    a suitable context, a Lojbanist may say:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e13d2"
name="e13d2">13.2)</a>    me'o se'erexarerei sinxa le ka panpi
    the-expression [code] 262E is-a-sign-of
        the quality-of being-at-peace
</pre>
    When a ``se'e'' string appears in running discourse, some
    metalinguistic convention must specify whether the number is
    base 10 (as above) or some other base, and which character set
    is in use.
