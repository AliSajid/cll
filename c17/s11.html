    <h3><a id="s11" name="s11">11. Mathematical uses of lerfu strings</h3>

    <p>This chapter is not about Lojban mathematics, which is
    explained in <a href="../c18/s1.html">Chapter 18</a>, so the
    mathematical uses of lerfu strings will be listed and
    exemplified but not explained.</p>

    <p>A lerfu string as mathematical variable:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e11d1" name="e11d1">11.1)</a>    li .abu du li by. su'i cy.
    the-number a equals the-number b plus c
    a = b + c
</pre>
    A lerfu string as function name (preceded by ``ma'o'' of
    selma'o MAhO): 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e11d2"
name="e11d2">11.2)</a>    li .y.bu du li ma'o fy. boi xy.
    the-number y equals the number the-function f of x
    y = f(x)
</pre>

    <p>Note the ``boi'' here to separate the lerfu strings ``fy''
    and ``xy''.</p>

    <p>A lerfu string as selbri (followed by a cmavo of selma'o
    MOI):</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e11d3"
name="e11d3">11.3)</a>    le vi ratcu ny.moi le'i mi ratcu
    the here rat is-nth-of the-set-of my rats
    This rat is my Nth rat.
</pre>
    A lerfu string as utterance ordinal (followed by a cmavo of
    selma'o MAI): 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e11d4" name="e11d4">11.4)</a>    ny.mai
    Nthly
</pre>
    A lerfu string as subscript (preceded by ``xi'' of selma'o XI):
    

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e11d5" name="e11d5">11.5)</a>    xy. xi ky.
    x sub k
</pre>
    A lerfu string as quantifier (enclosed in ``vei ... ve'o''
    parentheses): 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e11d6" name="e11d6">11.6)</a>    vei ny. [ve'o] lo prenu
    ( ``n'' ) persons
</pre>
    The parentheses are required because ``ny. lo prenu'' would be
    two separate sumti, ``ny.'' and ``lo prenu''. In general, any
    mathematical expression other than a simple number must be in
    parentheses when used as a quantifier; the right parenthesis
    mark, the cmavo ``ve'o'', can usually be elided. 

    <p>All the examples above have exhibited single lerfu words
    rather than lerfu strings, in accordance with the conventions
    of ordinary mathematics. A longer lerfu string would still be
    treated as a single variable or function name: in Lojban,
    ``.abu by. cy.'' is not the multiplication ``a x b x c'' but is
    the variable ``abc''. (Of course, a local convention could
    exist that made the value of a variable like ``abc'', with a
    multi-lerfu-word name, equal to the values of the variables
    ``a'', ``b'', and ``c'' multiplied together.)</p>

    <p>There is a special rule about shift words in mathematical
    text: shifts within mathematical expressions do not affect
    lerfu words appearing outside</p>

      <dt>mathematical expressions, and vice versa.</dt>
