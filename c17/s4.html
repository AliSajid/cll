    <h3><a id="s4" name="s4">4. The universal ``bu''</h3>

    <p>So far we have seen ``bu'' only as a suffix to vowel cmavo
    to produce vowel lerfu words. Originally, this was the only use
    of ``bu''. In developing the lerfu word system, however, it
    proved to be useful to allow ``bu'' to be attached to any word
    whatsoever, in order to allow arbitrary extensions of the basic
    lerfu word set.</p>

    <p>Formally, ``bu'' may be attached to any single Lojban word.
    Compound cmavo do not count as words for this purpose. The
    special cmavo ``ba'e'', ``za'e'', ``zei'', ``zo'', ``zoi'',
    ``la'o'', ``lo'u'', ``si'', ``sa'', ``su'', and ``fa'o'' may
    not have ``bu'' attached, because they are interpreted before
    ``bu'' detection is done; in particular,</p>

    the word ``bu''
</pre>
    is needed when discussing ``bu'' in Lojban. It is also illegal
    to attach ``bu'' to itself, but more than one ``bu'' may be
    attached to a word; thus ``.abubu'' is legal, if ugly. (Its
    meaning is not defined, but it is presumably different from
    ``.abu''.) It does not matter if the word is a cmavo, a cmene,
    or a brivla. All such words suffixed by ``bu'' are treated
    grammatically as if they were cmavo belonging to selma'o BY.
    However, if the word is a cmene it is always necessary to
    precede and follow it by a pause, because otherwise the cmene
    may absorb preceding or following words. 

    <p>The ability to attach ``bu'' to words has been used
    primarily to make names for various logograms and other unusual
    characters. For example, the Lojban name for the ``happy face''
    is ``.uibu'', based on the attitudinal ``.ui'' that means
    ``happiness''. Likewise, the ``smiley face'', written ``:-)''
    and used on computer networks to indicate humor, is called
    ``zo'obu'' The existence of these names does not mean that you
    should insert ``.uibu'' into running Lojban text to indicate
    that you are happy, or ``zo'obu'' when something is funny;
    instead, use the appropriate attitudinal directly.</p>

    <p>Likewise, ``joibu'' represents the ampersand character,
    ``&amp;'', based on the cmavo ``joi'' meaning ``mixed and''.
    Many more such lerfu words will probably be invented in
    future.</p>

    <p>The ``.'' and ``,'' characters used in Lojbanic writing to
    represent pause and syllable break respectively have been
    assigned the lerfu words ``denpa bu'' (literally, ``pause bu'')
    and ``slaka bu'' (literally, ``syllable bu''). The written
    space is mandatory here, because ``denpa'' and ``slaka'' are
    normal gismu with normal stress: ``denpabu'' would be a fu'ivla
    (word borrowed from another language into Lojban) stressed
    ``denPAbu''. No pause is required between ``denpa'' (or
    ``slaka'') and ``bu'', though.</p>
