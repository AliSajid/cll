    <h3><a id="s10" name="s10">10. References to lerfu</h3>

    <p>The rules of <a href="s9.html">Section 9</a> make it impossible
    to use unmarked lerfu words to refer to lerfu themselves. In
    the sentence:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e10d1" name="e10d1">10.1)</a>    .abu. cu lerfu
    A is-a-letteral.
</pre>
    the hearer would try to find what previous sumti ``.abu''
    refers to. The solution to this problem makes use of the cmavo
    ``me'o'' of selma'o LI, which makes a lerfu string into a sumti
    representing that very string of lerfu. This use of ``me'o'' is
    a special case of its mathematical use, which is to introduce a
    mathematical expression used literally rather than for its
    value. 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e10d2" name="e10d2">10.2)</a>    me'o .abu cu lerfu
    the-expression ``a'' is-a-letteral.
</pre>

    <p>Now we can translate <a href="#e1d1">Example 1.1</a> into
    Lojban:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e10d4" name="e10d4">10.4)</a>    dei vasru vo lerfu
        po'u me'o .ebu
    this-sentence contains four letterals
        which-are the-expression ``e''.
    This sentence contains four ``e''s.
</pre>

    <p>Since the Lojban sentence has only four ``e'' lerfu rather
    than fourteen, the translation is not a literal one --- but <a
    href="#e10d4">Example 10.4</a> is a Lojban truth just as <a
    href="#e1d1">Example 1.1</a> is an English truth.
    Coincidentally, the colloquial English translation of <a
    href="#e10d4">Example 10.4</a> is also true!</p>

    <p> The reader might be tempted to use quotation with ``lu ...
    li'u'' instead of ``me'o'', producing:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e10d4.5" name="e10d4.5">10.4.5)</a>    lu .abu li'u cu lerfu
    [quote] .abu [unquote] is-a-letteral.
</pre>
    (The single-word quote ``zo'' cannot be used, because ``.abu''
    is a compound cmavo.) But <a href="#e10d4">Example 10.4</a> is
    false, because it says: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e10d5"
name="e10d5">10.5)</a>    The word ``.abu'' is a letteral
</pre>
    which is not the case; rather, the thing symbolized by the word
    ``.abu'' is a letteral. In Lojban, that would be: 
<pre>
<a id="e10d6" name="e10d6">10.6)</a>    la'e lu .abu li'u cu lerfu
    The-referent-of [quote] .abu [unquote] is-a-letteral.
</pre>
    which is correct.
