    <h3><a id="s4" name="s4">4. gismu</h3>

    <p>The gismu, or Lojban root words, are those brivla
    representing concepts most basic to the language. The gismu
    were chosen for various reasons: some represent concepts that
    are very familiar and basic; some represent concepts that are
    frequently used in other languages; some were added because
    they would be helpful in constructing more complex words; some
    because they represent fundamental Lojban concepts (like
    ``cmavo'' and ``gismu'' themselves).</p>

    <p>The gismu do not represent any sort of systematic
    partitioning of semantic space. Some gismu may be superfluous,
    or appear for historical reasons: the gismu list was being
    collected for almost 35 years and was only weeded out once.
    Instead, the intention is that the gismu blanket semantic
    space: they make it possible to talk about the entire range of
    human concerns.</p>

    <p>There are about 1350 gismu. In learning Lojban, you need
    only to learn most of these gismu and their combining forms
    (known as ``rafsi'') as well as perhaps 200 major cmavo, and
    you will be able to communicate effectively in the language.
    This may sound like a lot, but it is a small number compared to
    the vocabulary needed for similar communications in other
    languages.</p>

    <p>All gismu have very strong form restrictions. Using the
    conventions defined in <a href="s1.html">Section 1</a>, all gismu
    are of the forms CVC/CV or CCVCV. They must meet the rules for
    all brivla given in <a href="s3.html">Section 3</a>; furthermore,
    they:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>1)</dt>

      <dd>always have five letters;</dd>

      <dt>2)</dt>

      <dd>always start with a consonant and end with a single
      vowel;</dd>

      <dt>3)</dt>

      <dd>always contain exactly one consonant pair, which is a
      permissible initial pair (CC) if it's at the beginning of the
      gismu, but otherwise only has to be a permissible pair
      (C/C);</dd>

      <dt>4)</dt>

      <dd>are always stressed on the first syllable (since that is
      penultimate).</dd>
    </dl>
    The five letter length distinguishes gismu from lujvo and
    fu'ivla. (It is possible to have fu'ivla like ``spa'i'' that
    are five letters long, but they must have ``'''; no gismu
    contains ``'''.) 

    <p>With the exception of five special brivla variables,
    ``broda'', ``brode'', ``brodi'', ``brodo'', and ``brodu'', no
    two gismu differ only in the final vowel. Furthermore, the set
    of gismu was specifically designed to reduce the likelihood
    that two similar sounding gismu could be confused. For example,
    because ``gismu'' is in the set of gismu, ``kismu'', ``xismu'',
    ``gicmu'', ``gizmu'', and ``gisnu'' cannot be.</p>

    <p>Almost all Lojban gismu are constructed from pieces of words
    drawn from other languages, specifically Chinese, English,
    Hindi, Spanish, Russian, and Arabic, the six most widely spoken
    natural languages. For a given concept, words in the six
    languages that represent that concept were written in Lojban
    phonetics. Then a gismu was selected to maximize the
    recognizability of the Lojban word for speakers of the six
    languages by weighting the inclusion of the sounds drawn from
    each language by the number of speakers of that language. See
    <a href="s14.html">Section 14</a> for a full explanation of the
    algorithm.</p>

    <p>Here are a few examples of gismu, with rough English
    equivalents (not definitions):</p>
