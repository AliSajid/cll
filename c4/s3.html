          <h3><a id="s3" name="s3">3. brivla</h3>

    <p>Predicate words, called ``brivla'', are at the core of
    Lojban. They carry most of the semantic information in the
    language. They serve as the equivalent of English nouns, verbs,
    adjectives, and adverbs, all in a single part of speech.</p>

    <p>Every brivla belongs to one of three major subtypes. These
    subtypes are defined by the form, or morphology, of the word
    --- all words of a particular structure can be assigned by
    sight or sound to a particular type (cmavo, brivla, or cmene)
    and subtype. Knowing the type and subtype then gives you, the
    reader or listener, significant clues to the meaning and the
    origin of the word, even if you have never heard the word
    before.</p>

    <p>The same principle allows you, when speaking or writing, to
    invent new brivla for new concepts ``on the fly''; yet it
    offers people that you are trying to communicate with a good
    chance to figure out your meaning. In this way, Lojban has a
    flexible vocabulary which can be expanded indefinitely.</p>

    <p>All brivla have the following properties:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>1)</dt>

      <dd>always end in a vowel;</dd>

      <dt>2)</dt>

      <dd>always contain a consonant pair in the first five
      letters, where ``y'' and apostrophe are not counted as
      letters for this purpose. (See <a href="s6.html">Section
      6</a>.)</dd>

      <dt>3)</dt>

      <dd>always are stressed on the next-to-the-last (penultimate)
      syllable; this implies that they have two or more
      syllables.</dd>
    </dl>
    The presence of a consonant pair distinguishes brivla from
    cmavo and their compounds. The final vowel distinguishes brivla
    from cmene, which always end in a consonant. Thus ``da'amei''
    must be a compound cmavo because it lacks a consonant pair;
    ``lojban.'' must be a name because it lacks a final vowel. 

    <p>Thus, ``bisycla'' has the consonant pair ``sc'' in the first
    five non-``y'' letters even though the ``sc'' actually appears
    in the form of ``syc''. Similarly, the word ``ro'inre'o''
    contains ``nr'' in the first five letters because the
    apostrophes are not counted for this purpose.</p>

    <p>The three subtypes of brivla are:</p>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dt>1)</dt>

      <dd>gismu, the Lojban primitive roots from which all other
      brivla are built;</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>2)</dt>

      <dd>lujvo, the compounds of two or more gismu; and</dd>
    </dl>
<pre>
3) fu'ivla (literally ``copy-word''), the specialized
    words that are not Lojban primitives or natural
    compounds, and are therefore borrowed from other
    languages.
