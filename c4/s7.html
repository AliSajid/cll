    <h3><a id="s7" name="s7">7. fu'ivla</h3>

    <p>The use of tanru or lujvo is not always appropriate for very
    concrete or specific terms (e.g. ``brie'' or ``cobra''), or for
    jargon words specialized to a narrow field (e.g. ``quark'',
    ``integral'', or ``iambic pentameter''). These words are in
    effect names for concepts, and the names were invented by
    speakers of another language. The vast majority of words
    referring to plants, animals, foods, and scientific terminology
    cannot be easily expressed as tanru. They thus must be borrowed
    (actually ``copied'') into Lojban from the original
    language.</p>

    <p>There are four stages of borrowing in Lojban, as words
    become more and more modified (but shorter and easier to use).
    Stage 1 is the use of a foreign name quoted with the cmavo
    ``la'o'' (explained in full in <a href="../c19/s1.html">Chapter
    19</a>):</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e7d1" name="e7d1">7.1)</a>  me la'o ly. spaghetti .ly.
</pre>
    is a predicate with the place structure ``x1 is a quantity of
    spaghetti''. 

    <p>Stage 2 involves changing the foreign name to a Lojbanized
    name, as explained in <a href="s8.html">Section 8</a>:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e7d2" name="e7d2">7.2)</a>  me la spagetis.
</pre>

    <p>One of these expedients is often quite sufficient when you
    need a word quickly in conversation. (This can make it easier
    to get by when you do not yet have full command of the Lojban
    vocabulary, provided you are talking to someone who will
    recognize the borrowing.)</p>

    <p>Where a little more universality is desired, the word to be
    borrowed must be Lojbanized into one of several permitted
    forms. A rafsi is then usually attached to the beginning of the
    Lojbanized form, using a hyphen to ensure that the resulting
    word doesn't fall apart.</p>

    <p>The rafsi categorizes or limits the meaning of the fu'ivla;
    otherwise a word having several different jargon meanings in
    other languages would require the word-inventor to choose which
    meaning should be assigned to the fu'ivla, since fu'ivla (like
    other brivla) are not permitted to have more than one
    definition. Such a Stage 3 borrowing is the most common kind of
    fu'ivla.</p>

    <p>Finally, Stage 4 fu'ivla do not have any rafsi classifier,
    and are used where a fu'ivla has become so common or so
    important that it must be made as short as possible. (See <a
    href="s16.html">Section 16</a> for a proposal concerning Stage 4
    fu'ivla.)</p>

    <p>The form of a fu'ivla reliably distinguishes it from both
    the gismu and the cmavo. Like cultural gismu, fu'ivla are
    generally based on a word from a single non-Lojban language.
    The word is ``borrowed'' (actually ``copied'', hence the Lojban
    tanru ``fukpi valsi'') from the other language and Lojbanized
    --- the phonemes are converted to their closest Lojban
    equivalent and modifications are made as necessary to make the
    word a legitimate Lojban fu'ivla-form word. All fu'ivla:</p>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dt>1)</dt>

      <dd>must contain a consonant cluster in the first five
      letters of the word; if this consonant cluster is at the
      beginning, it must either be a permissible initial consonant
      pair, or a longer cluster such that each pair of adjacent
      consonants in the cluster is a permissible initial consonant
      pair: ``spraile'' is acceptable, but not ``ktraile'' or
      ``trkaile'';</dd>

      <dt>2)</dt>

      <dd>must end in one or more vowels;</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>3)</dt>

      <dd>must not be gismu or lujvo, or any combination of cmavo,
      gismu, and lujvo; furthermore, a fu'ivla with a CV cmavo
      joined to the front of it must not have the form of a lujvo
      (the so-called ``slinku'i test'');</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>4)</dt>

      <dd>cannot contain ``y'', although they may contain syllabic
      pronunciations of Lojban consonants;</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>5)</dt>

      <dd>like other brivla, are stressed on the penultimate
      syllable.</dd>
    </dl>
    Note that consonant triples or larger clusters that are not at
    the beginning of a fu'ivla can be quite flexible, as long as
    all consonant pairs are permissible. There is no need to
    restrict fu'ivla clusters to permissible initial pairs except
    at the beginning. 

    <p>This is a fairly liberal definition and allows quite a lot
    of possibilities within ``fu'ivla space''. Stage 3 fu'ivla can
    be made easily on the fly, as lujvo can, because the procedure
    for forming them always guarantees a word that cannot violate
    any of the rules. Stage 4 fu'ivla require running tests that
    are not simple to characterize or perform, and should be made
    only after deliberation and by someone knowledgeable about all
    the considerations that apply.</p>

    <p>Here is a simple and reliable procedure for making a
    non-Lojban word into a valid Stage 3 fu'ivla:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>1)</dt>

      <dd>Eliminate all double consonants and silent letters.</dd>

      <dt>2)</dt>

      <dd>Convert all sounds to their closest Lojban equivalents.
      Lojban ``y'', however, may not be used in any fu'ivla.</dd>

      <dt>3)</dt>

      <dd>If the last letter is not a vowel, modify the ending so
      that the word ends in a vowel, either by removing a final
      consonant or by adding a suggestively chosen final
      vowel.</dd>

      <dt>4)</dt>

      <dd>If the first letter is not a consonant, modify the
      beginning so that the word begins with a consonant, either by
      removing an initial vowel or adding a suggestively chosen
      initial consonant.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>5)</dt>

      <dd>Prefix the result of steps 1-5 with a 4-letter rafsi that
      categorizes the fu'ivla into a ``topic area''. It is only
      safe to use a 4-letter rafsi; short rafsi sometimes produce
      invalid fu'ivla. Hyphenate the rafsi to the rest of the
      fu'ivla with an ``r''-hyphen; if that would produce a double
      ``r'', use an ``n''-hyphen instead; if the rafsi ends in
      ``r'' and the rest of the fu'ivla begins with ``n'' (or vice
      versa) use an ``l''-hyphen. (This is the only use of
      ``l''-hyphen in Lojban.)</dd>

      <dt></dt>

      <dd>Alternatively, if a CVC-form short rafsi is available it
      can be used instead of the long rafsi.</dd>

      <dt>6)</dt>

      <dd>Remember that the stress necessarily appears on the
      penultimate (next-to-the-last) syllable.</dd>
    </dl>
    In this section, the hyphen is set off with commas in the
    examples, but these commas are not required in writing, and the
    hyphen need not be pronounced as a separate syllable. 

    <p>Here are a few examples:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e7d3" name="e7d3">7.3)</a>  spaghetti (from English or Italian)
    spageti (Lojbanize)
    cidj,r,spageti (prefix long rafsi)
    dja,r,spageti (prefix short rafsi)
</pre>
    where ``cidj-'' is the 4-letter rafsi for ``cidja'', the Lojban
    gismu for ``food'', thus categorizing ``cidjrspageti'' as a
    kind of food. The form with the short rafsi happens to work,
    but such good fortune cannot be relied on: in any event, it
    means the same thing. 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e7d4" name="e7d4">7.4)</a>  Acer (the scientific name of maple trees)
    acer (Lojbanize)
    xaceru (add initial consonant and final vowel)
    tric,r,xaceru (prefix rafsi)
    ric,r,xaceru (prefix short rafsi)
</pre>
    where ``tric-'' and ``ric-'' are rafsi for ``tricu'', the gismu
    for ``tree''. Note that by the same principles, ``maple sugar''
    could get the fu'ivla ``saktrxaceru'', or could be represented
    by the tanru ``tricrxaceru sakta''. Technically, ``ricrxaceru''
    and ``tricrxaceru'' are distinct fu'ivla, but they would surely
    be given the same meanings if both happened to be in use. 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e7d5" name="e7d5">7.5)</a>  brie (from French)
    bri (Lojbanize)
    cirl,r,bri (prefix rafsi)
</pre>
    where ``cirl-'' represents ``cirla'' (``cheese''). 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e7d6" name="e7d6">7.6)</a>  cobra
    kobra (Lojbanize)
    sinc,r,kobra (prefix rafsi)
</pre>
    where ``sinc-'' represents ``since'' (``snake''). 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e7d7" name="e7d7">7.7)</a>  quark
    kuark (Lojbanize)
    kuarka (add final vowel)
    sask,r,kuarka (prefix rafsi)
</pre>
    where ``sask-'' represents ``saske'' (``science''). Note the
    extra vowel ``a'' added to the end of the word, and the
    diphthong ``ua'', which never appears in gismu or lujvo, but
    may appear in fu'ivla. 

    <p>The use of the prefix helps distinguish among the many
    possible meanings of the borrowed word, depending on the field.
    As it happens, ``spageti'' and ``kuarka'' are valid Stage 4
    fu'ivla, but ``xaceru'' looks like a compound cmavo, and
    ``kobra'' like a gismu.</p>

    <p>For another example, ``integral'' has a specific meaning to
    a mathematician. But the Lojban fu'ivla ``integrale'', which is
    a valid Stage 4 fu'ivla, does not convey that mathematical
    sense to a non-mathematical listener, even one with an
    English-speaking background; its source --- the English word
    ``integral'' --- has various other specialized meanings in
    other fields.</p>

    <p>Left uncontrolled, ``integrale'' almost certainly would
    eventually come to mean the same collection of loosely related
    concepts that English associates with ``integral'', with only
    the context to indicate (possibly) that the mathematical term
    is meant.</p>

    <p>The prefix method would render the mathematical concept as
    ``cmacrntegrale'', if the ``i'' of ``integrale'' is removed, or
    something like ``cmacrnintegrale'', if a new consonant is added
    to the beginning; ``cmac-'' is the rafsi for ``cmaci''
    (``mathematics''). The architectural sense of ``integral''
    might be conveyed with ``djinrnintegrale'' or
    ``tarmrnintegrale'', where ``dinju'' and ``tarmi'' mean
    ``building'' and ``form'' respectively.</p>

    <p>Here are some fu'ivla representing cultures and related
    things, shown with more than one rafsi prefix:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e7d8" name="e7d8">7.8)</a>  bang,r,blgaria
    Bulgarian (in language)

<a id="e7d9" name="e7d9">7.9)</a>   kuln,r,blgaria
    Bulgarian (in culture)

<a id="e7d10" name="e7d10">7.10)</a> gugd,r,blgaria
    Bulgaria (the country)
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="e7d11" name="e7d11">7.11)</a>    bang,r,kore,a
    Korean (the language)

<a id="e7d12" name="e7d12">7.12)</a> kuln,r,kore,a
    Korean (the culture)
</pre>
    Note the commas in <a href="#e7d11">Examples 7.11</a> and <a
    href="#e7d12">7.12</a>, used because ``ea'' is not a valid
    diphthong in Lojban. Arguably, some form of the native name
    ``Chosen'' should have been used instead of the internationally
    known ``Korea''; this is a recurring problem in all borrowings.
    In general, it is better to use the native name unless using it
    will severely impede understanding: ``Navajo'' is far more
    widely known than ``Dine'e''.
