    <h3><a id="s13" name="s13">13. lujvo-making examples</h3>

    <p>This section contains examples of making and scoring lujvo.
    First, we will start with the tanru ``gerku zdani'' (``dog
    house'') and construct a lujvo meaning ``doghouse'', that is, a
    house where a dog lives. We will use a brute-force application
    of the algorithm in <a href="s12.html">Section 12</a>, using every
    possible rafsi.</p>

    <p>The rafsi for ``gerku'' are:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>-ger-, -ge'u-, -gerk-, -gerku</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>The rafsi for ``zdani'' are:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>-zda-, -zdan-, -zdani.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Step 1 of the algorithm directs us to use ``-ger-'',
    ``-ge'u-'' and ``-gerk-'' as possible rafsi for ``gerku''; Step
    2 directs us to use ``-zda-'' and ``-zdani'' as possible rafsi
    for ``zdani''. The six possible forms of the lujvo are
    then:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>ger-zda ger-zdani ge'u-zda ge'u-zdani gerk-zda
      gerk-zdani</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>We must then insert appropriate hyphens in each case. The
    first two forms need no hyphenation: ``ge'' cannot fall off the
    front, because the following word would begin with ``rz'',
    which is not a permissible initial consonant pair. So the lujvo
    forms are ``gerzda'' and ``gerzdani''.</p>

    <p>The third form, ``ge'u-zda'', needs no hyphen, because even
    though the first rafsi is CVV, the second one is CCV, so there
    is a consonant cluster in the first five letters. So
    ``ge'uzda'' is this form of the lujvo.</p>

    <p>The fourth form, ``ge'u-zdani'', however, requires an
    ``r''-hyphen; otherwise, the ``ge'u-'' part would fall off as a
    cmavo. So this form of the lujvo is ``ge'urzdani''.</p>

    <p>The last two forms require ``y''-hyphens, as all 4-letter
    rafsi do, and so are ``gerkyzda'' and ``gerkyzdani''
    respectively.</p>

    <p>The scoring algorithm is heavily weighted in favor of short
    lujvo, so we might expect that ``gerzda'' would win. Its L
    score is 6, its A score is 0, its H score is 0, its R score is
    12, and its V score is 3, for a final score of 5878. The other
    forms have scores of 7917, 6367, 9506, 8008, and 10047
    respectively. Consequently, this lujvo would probably appear in
    the dictionary in the form ``gerzda''.</p>

    <p>For the next example, we will use the tanru ``bloti klesi''
    (``boat class'') presumably referring to the category (rowboat,
    motorboat, cruise liner) into which a boat falls. We will omit
    the long rafsi from the process, since lujvo containing long
    rafsi are almost never preferred by the scoring algorithm when
    there are short rafsi available.</p>

    <p>The rafsi for ``bloti'' are ``-lot-'', ``-blo-'', and
    ``-lo'i-''; for ``klesi'' they are ``-kle-'' and ``-lei-''.
    Both these gismu are among the handful which have both CVV-form
    and CCV-form rafsi, so there is an unusual number of
    possibilities available for a two-part tanru:</p>
<pre>
   lotkle      blokle      lo'ikle
    lotlei      blolei      lo'irlei
</pre>

    <p>Only ``lo'irlei'' requires hyphenation (to avoid confusion
    with the cmavo sequence ``lo'i lei''). All six forms are valid
    versions of the lujvo, as are the six further forms using long
    rafsi; however, the scoring algorithm produces the following
    results:</p>
<pre>
   lotkle 5878 blokle 5858 lo'ikle 6367
    lotlei 5867 blolei 5847 lo'irlei 7456
</pre>

    <p>So the form ``blolei'' is preferred, but only by a tiny
    margin over ``blokle''; the next two forms are only slightly
    worse; ``lo'ikle'' suffers because of its apostrophe, and
    ``lo'irlei'' because of having both apostrophe and hyphen.</p>

    <p>Our third example will result in forming both a lujvo and a
    name from the tanru ``logji bangu girzu'', or
    ``logical-language group'' in English. (``The Logical Language
    Group'' is the name of the publisher of this book and the
    organization for the promotion of Lojban.) The available rafsi
    are ``-loj-'' and ``-logj-''; ``-ban-'', ``-bau-'', and
    ``-bang-''; and ``-gri-'' and ``-girzu'', and (for name
    purposes only) ``-gir-'' and ``-girz-''. The resulting 12 lujvo
    possibilities are:</p>
<pre>
   loj-ban-gri loj-bau-gri loj-bang-gri
    logj-ban-gri    logj-bau-gri    logj-bang-gri
    loj-ban-girzu   loj-bau-girzu   loj-bang-girzu
    logj-ban-girzu  logj-bau-girzu  logj-bang-girzu
</pre>
    and the 12 name possibilities are: 
<pre>
   loj-ban-gir.    loj-bau-gir.    loj-bang-gir.
    logj-ban-gir.   logj-bau-gir.   logj-bang-gir.
    loj-ban-girz.   loj-bau-girz.   loj-bang-girz.
    logj-ban-girz.  logj-bau-girz.  logj-bang-girz.
</pre>

    <p>After hyphenation, we have:</p>
<pre>
   lojbangri   lojbaugri   lojbangygri
    logjybangri logjybaugri logjybangygri
    lojbangirzu lojbaugirzu lojbangygirzu
    logjybangirzu   logjybaugirzu   logjybangygirzu

    lojbangir.  lojbaugir.  lojbangygir.
    logjybangir.    logjybaugir.    logjybangygir.
    lojbangirz. lojbaugirz. lojbangygirz.
    logjybangirz.   logjybaugirz.   logjybangygirz.
</pre>

    <p>The only fully reduced lujvo forms are ``lojbangri'' and
    ``lojbaugri'', of which the latter has a slightly lower score:
    8827 versus 8796, respectively. However, for the name of the
    organization, we chose to make sure the name of the language
    was embedded in it, and to use the clearer long-form rafsi for
    ``girzu'', producing ``lojbangirz.''</p>

    <p>Finally, here is a four-part lujvo with a cmavo in it, based
    on the tanru ``nakni ke cinse ctuca'' or ``male (sexual
    teacher)''. The ``ke'' cmavo ensures the interpretation
    ``teacher of sexuality who is male'', rather than ``teacher of
    male sexuality''. Here are the possible forms of the lujvo,
    both before and after hyphenation:</p>
<pre>
   nak-kem-cin-ctu     nakykemcinctu
    nak-kem-cin-ctuca   nakykemcinctuca
    nak-kem-cins-ctu    nakykemcinsyctu
    nak-kem-cins-ctuca  nakykemcinsyctuca
    nakn-kem-cin-ctu    naknykemcinctu
    nakn-kem-cin-ctuca  naknykemcinctuca
    nakn-kem-cins-ctu   naknykemcinsyctu
    nakn-kem-cins-ctuca naknykemcinsyctuca
</pre>

    <p>Of these forms, ``nakykemcinctu'' is the shortest and is
    preferred by the scoring algorithm. On the whole, however, it
    might be better to just make a lujvo for ``cinse ctuca'' (which
    would be ``cinctu'') since the sex of the teacher is rarely
    important. If there was a reason to specify ``male'', then the
    simpler tanru ``nakni cinctu'' (``male sexual-teacher'') would
    be appropriate. This tanru is actually shorter than the
    four-part lujvo, since the ``ke'' required for grouping need
    not be expressed.</p>
