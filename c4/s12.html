    <h3><a id="s12" name="s12">12. The lujvo scoring algorithm</h3>

    <p>This algorithm was devised by Bob and Nora LeChevalier in
    1989. It is not the only possible algorithm, but it usually
    gives a choice that people find preferable. The algorithm may
    be changed in the future. The lowest-scoring variant will
    usually be the dictionary form of the lujvo. (In previous
    versions, it was the highest-scoring variant.)</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>1)</dt>

      <dd>Count the total number of letters, including hyphens and
      apostrophes; call it ``L''.</dd>

      <dt>2)</dt>

      <dd>Count the number of apostrophes; call it ``A''.</dd>

      <dt>3)</dt>

      <dd>Count the number of ``y''-, ``r''-, and ``n''-hyphens;
      call it ``H''.</dd>

      <dt>4)</dt>

      <dd>For each rafsi, find the value in the following table.
      Sum this value over all rafsi; call it ``R'':</dd>

      <dt></dt>

      <dd>CVC/CV (final) (-sarji) 1 CVC/C (-sarj-) 2 CCVCV (final)
      (-zbasu) 3 CCVC (-zbas-) 4 CVC (-nun-) 5 CVV with an
      apostrophe (-ta'u-) 6 CCV (-zba-) 7 CVV with no apostrophe
      (-sai-) 8</dd>

      <dt>5)</dt>

      <dd>Count the number of vowels, not including ``y''; call it
      ``V''.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>The score is then:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>(1000 * L) - (500 * A) + (100 * H) - (10 * R) - V</dd>
    </dl>
    In case of ties, there is no preference. This should be rare.
    Note that the algorithm essentially encodes a hierarchy of
    priorities: short words are preferred (counting apostrophes as
    half a letter), then words with fewer hyphens, words with more
    pleasing rafsi (this judgment is subjective), and finally words
    with more vowels are chosen. Each decision principle is applied
    in turn if the ones before it have failed to choose; it is
    possible that a lower-ranked principle might dominate a
    higher-ranked one if it is ten times better than the
    alternative. 

    <p>Here are some lujvo with their scores (not necessarily the
    lowest scoring forms for these lujvo, nor even necessarily
    sensible lujvo):</p>
