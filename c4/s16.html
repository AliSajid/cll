    <h3><a id="s16" name="s16">16. rafsi fu'ivla: a proposal</h3>

    <p>The list of cultures represented by gismu, given in <a
    href="s15.html">Section 15</a>, is unavoidably controversial. Much
    time has been spent debating whether this or that culture
    ``deserves a gismu'' or ``must languish in fu'ivla space''. To
    help defuse this argument, a last-minute proposal was made when
    this book was already substantially complete. I have added it
    here with experimental status: it is not yet a standard part of
    Lojban, since all its implications have not been tested in open
    debate, and it affects a part of the language (lujvo-making)
    that has long been stable, but is known to be fragile in the
    face of small changes. (Many attempts were made to add general
    mechanisms for making lujvo that contained fu'ivla, but all
    failed on obvious or obscure counterexamples; finally the
    general ``zei'' mechanism was devised instead.)</p>

    <p>The first part of the proposal is uncontroversial and
    involves no change to the language mechanisms. All valid Type 4
    fu'ivla of the form CCVVCV would be reserved for cultural
    brivla analogous to those described in <a href="s15.html">Section
    15</a>. For example,</p>
<pre>
<a id="e16d1" name="e16d1">16.1)</a>    tci'ile
    Chilean
</pre>
    is of the appropriate form, and passes all tests required of a
    Stage 4 fu'ivla. No two fu'ivla of this form would be allowed
    to coexist if they differed only in the final vowel; this rule
    was applied to gismu, but does not apply to other fu'ivla or to
    lujvo. 

    <p>The second, and fully experimental, part of the proposal is
    to allow rafsi to be formed from these cultural fu'ivla by
    removing the final vowel and treating the result as a 4-letter
    rafsi (although it would contain five letters, not four). These
    rafsi could then be used on a par with all other rafsi in
    forming lujvo. The tanru</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e16d2" name="e16d2">16.2)</a>    tci'ile ke canre tutra
    Chilean type-of (sand territory)
    Chilean desert
</pre>
    could be represented by the lujvo 
<pre>
<a id="e16d3" name="e16d3">16.3)</a>    tci'ilykemcantutra
</pre>
    which is an illegal word in standard Lojban, but a valid lujvo
    under this proposal. There would be no short rafsi or 5-letter
    rafsi assigned to any fu'ivla, so no fu'ivla could appear as
    the last element of a lujvo. 

    <p>The cultural fu'ivla introduced under this proposal are
    called ``rafsi fu'ivla'', since they are distinguished from
    other Type 4 fu'ivla by the property of having rafsi. If this
    proposal is workable and introduces no problems into Lojban
    morphology, it might become standard for all Type 4 fu'ivla,
    including those made for plants, animals, foodstuffs, and other
    things.</p>
