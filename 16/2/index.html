          <h3>2. Existential claims, prenexes, and variables</h3>

    <p>Let us consider, to begin with, a sentence that is not in
    the dialogue:

<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">2.1)</a>   Something sees me.
</pre>

    There are two plausible Lojban translations of <a
    href="../2/#1">Example 2.1</a>. The simpler one is:

<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">2.2)</a>   [zo'e] viska mi
       Something-unspecified sees me.
</pre>

    The cmavo “zo'e” indicates that a sumti has been omitted
    (indeed, even “zo'e” itself can be omitted in this case, as
    explained in <a href="../../7/1/">Chapter 7</a>) and the
    listener must fill in the correct value from context. In other
    words, <a href="../2/#2">Example 2.2</a> means “‘You-know-what’
    sees me.”</p>

    <p>However, <a href="../2/#1">Example 2.1</a> is just as likely
    to assert simply that there is someone who sees me, in which
    case a correct translation is:

<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">2.3)</a>   da zo'u da viska mi
       There-is-an-X such-that X sees me.
</pre>

    <a href="../2/#3">Example 2.3</a> does not presuppose that the
    listener knows who sees the speaker, but simply tells the
    listener that there is someone who sees the speaker. Statements
    of this kind are called “existential claims”. (Formally, the
    one doing the seeing is not restricted to being a person; it
    could be an animal or &mdash; in principle &mdash; an inanimate object.
    We will see in <a href=../4/>Section 4</a> how to represent
    such restrictions.)</p>

    <p><a href="../2/#3">Example 2.3</a> has a two-part structure:
    there is the part “da zo'u”, called the prenex, and the part
    “da viska mi”, the main bridi. Almost any Lojban bridi can be
    preceded by a prenex, which syntactically is any number of
    sumti followed by the cmavo “zo'u” (of selma'o ZOhU). For the
    moment, the sumti will consist of one or more of the cmavo
    “da”, “de”, and “di” (of selma'o KOhA), glossed in the
    literal translations as “X”, “Y”, and “Z” respectively.
    By analogy to the terminology of symbolic logic, these cmavo
    are called “variables”.</p>

    <p>Here is an example of a prenex with two variables:

<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">2.4)</a>   da de zo'u da prami de
       There-is-an-X there-is-a-Y such that X loves Y.
       Somebody loves somebody.
</pre>

    In <a href="../2/#4">Example 2.4</a>, the literal interpretation
    of the two variables “da” and “de” as “there-is-an-X” and
    “there-is-a-Y” tells us that there are two things which stand
    in the relationship that one loves the other. It might be the
    case that the supposed two things are really just a single
    thing that loves itself; nothing in the Lojban version of <a
    href="../2/#4">Example 2.4</a> rules out that interpretation,
    which is why the colloquial translation does not say “Somebody
    loves somebody else.” The things referred to by different
    variables may be different or the same. (We use “somebody”
    here rather than “something” for naturalness; lovers and
    beloveds are usually persons, though the Lojban does not say
    so.)</p>

    <p>It is perfectly all right for the variables to appear more
    than once in the main bridi:

<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">2.5)</a>   da zo'u da prami da
       There-is-an-X such that X loves X
       Somebody loves himself/herself.
</pre>

    What <a href="../2/#5">Example 2.5</a> claims is fundamentally
    different from what <a href="../2/#4">Example 2.4</a> claims,
    because “da prami da” is not structurally the same as “da
    prami de”. However, 

<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">2.6)</a>   de zo'u de prami de
       There-is-a-Y such that Y loves Y
</pre>

    means exactly the same thing as <a href="../2/#5">Example
    2.5</a>; it does not matter which variable is used as long as
    they are used consistently.</p>

    <p>It is not necessary for a variable to be a sumti of the main
    bridi directly:

<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">2.7)</a>   da zo'u le da gerku cu viska mi
       There-is-an-X such-that the of-X dog sees me
       Somebody’s dog sees me
</pre>

    is perfectly correct even though the “da” is used only in a
    possessive construction. (Possessives are explained in <a
    href="../../8/1/">Chapter 8</a>.)</p>

    <p>It is very peculiar, however, even if technically
    grammatical, for the variable not to appear in the main bridi
    at all:

<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">2.8)</a>   da zo'u la ralf. gerku
       There is something such that Ralph is a dog.
</pre>
    has a variable bound in a prenex whose relevance to the claim
    of the following bridi is completely unspecified.</p>
