          <h3>5. Dropping the prenex</h3>

    <p>It isn’t really necessary for every Lojban bridi involving
    variables to have a prenex on the front. In fact, none of the
    examples we’ve seen so far required prenexes at all! The rule
    for dropping the prenex is simple: if the variables appear in
    the same order within the bridi as they did in the prenex, then
    the prenex is superfluous. However, any “ro” or “poi”
    appearing in the prenex must be transferred to the first
    occurrence of the variable in the main part of the bridi. Thus,
    <a href="../2/#3">Example 2.3</a> becomes just:

<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">5.1)</a>   da viska mi
       There-is-an-X-which sees me.
       Something sees me.
</pre>

    and <a href="../4/#4">Example 4.4</a> becomes: 

<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">5.2)</a>   ro da poi gerku cu vasxu
       For-every X which is-a-dog, it-breathes.
       Every dog breathes.
</pre>

    You might well suppose, then, that the purpose of the prenex is
    to allow the variables in it to appear in a different order
    than the bridi order, and that would be correct. Consider 

<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">5.3)</a>   ro da poi prenu ku'o
            de poi gerku ku'o zo'u
                 de batci da
       For-every X which is-a-person,
            there-is-a-Y which is-a-dog:
                 Y bites X.
</pre>

    The prenex of <a href="../5/#3">Example 5.3</a> is like that
    of <a href="../3/#4">Example 3.4</a> (but with relative clauses):
    it notes that the following bridi is true of every person with
    respect to some dog, not necessarily the same dog for each. But
    in the main bridi part, the “de” appears before the “da”.
    Therefore, the true translation is

<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">5.4)</a>   Every person is bitten by some dog (or other).
</pre>

    If we tried to omit the prenex and move the “ro” and the
    relative clauses into the main bridi, we would get:

<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">5.5)</a>   de poi gerku cu batci
            ro da poi prenu
       There-is-a-Y which is-a-dog which-bites
            every Y which is-a-person
       Some dog bites everyone.
</pre>

    which has the structure of <a href="../3/#5">Example 3.5</a>: it
    says that there is a dog (call him Fido) who bites, has bitten,
    or will bite every person that has ever existed! We can safely
    rule out Fido’s existence, and say that <a href="../5/#5">Example
    5.5</a> is false, while agreeing to <a href="../5/#3">Example
    5.3</a>.</p>

    <p>Even so, <a href="../5/#3">Example 5.3</a> is most probably
    false, since some people never experience dogbite. Examples
    like 5.3 and 4.4 (might there be some dogs which never have
    breathed, because they died as embryos?) indicate the danger in
    Lojban of universal claims even when restricted. In English we
    are prone to say that “Everyone says” or that “Everybody
    does” or that “Everything is” when in fact there are obvious
    counterexamples which we are ignoring for the sake of making a
    rhetorical point. Such statements are plain falsehoods in
    Lojban, unless saved by a context (such as tense) which
    implicitly restricts them.</p>

    <p>How can we express <a href="../5/#3">Example 5.3</a> in Lojban
    without a prenex? Since it is the order in which variables
    appear that matters, we can say:

<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">5.6)</a>   ro da poi prenu cu se batci
            de poi gerku
       Every-X which is-a-person is-bitten-by some-Y
            which is-a-dog.
</pre>

    using the conversion operator “se” (explained in <a
    href="../../5/1/">Chapter 5</a>) to change the selbri “batci”
    (“bites”) into “se batci” (“is bitten by”). The
    translation given in <a href="../5/#4">Example 5.4</a> uses the
    corresponding strategy in English, since English does not have
    prenexes (except in strained “logician’s English”). This
    implies that a sentence with both a universal and an
    existential variable can’t be freely converted with “se”; one
    must be careful to preserve the order of the variables.</p>

    <p>If a variable occurs more than once, then any “ro” or
    “poi” decorations are moved only to the first occurrence of
    the variable when the prenex is dropped. For example,

<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">5.7)</a>   di poi prenu zo'u
            ti xarci di di
       There-is-a-Z which is-a-person :
            this-thing is-a-weapon for-use-against-Z by-Z
       This is a weapon for someone to use against
            himself/herself.
</pre>

    (in which “di” is used rather than “da” just for variety)
    loses its prenex as follows: 

<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">5.8)</a>   ti xarci di
            poi prenu ku'o di
       This-thing is-a-weapon-for-use-against
            some-Z which is-a-person by-Z.
</pre>

    As the examples in this section show, dropping the prenex makes
    for terseness of expression often even greater than that of
    English (Lojban is meant to be an unambiguous language, not
    necessarily a terse or verbose one), provided the rules are
    observed.</p>
