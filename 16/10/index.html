          <h3>10. bridi negation and logical connectives</h3>

    <p>A complete discussion of logical connectives appears in <a
    href="../../14/1/">Chapter 14</a>. What is said here is
    intentionally quite incomplete and makes several
    oversimplifications.</p>

    <p>A logical connective is a cmavo or compound cmavo. In this
    chapter, we will make use of the logical connectives “and”
    and “or” (where “or” really means “and/or”, “either or
    both”). The following simplified recipes explain how to make
    some logical connectives:</p>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>To logically connect two Lojban sumti with “and”, put
      them both in the bridi and separate them with the cmavo
      “.e”.</dd>

      <dt></dt>

      <dd>To logically connect two Lojban bridi with “and”,
      replace the regular separator cmavo “.i” with the compound
      cmavo “.ije”.</dd>

      <dt></dt>

      <dd>To logically connect two Lojban sumti with “or”, put
      them both in the bridi and separate them with the cmavo
      “.a”.</dd>

      <dt></dt>

      <dd>To logically connect two Lojban bridi with “or”,
      replace the regular separator cmavo “.i” with the compound
      cmavo “.ija”.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>More complex logical connectives also exist; in particular,
    one may place “na” before “.e” or “.a”, or between “.i”
    and “je” or “ja”; likewise, one may place “nai” at the
    end of a connective. Both “na” and “nai” have negative
    effects on the sumti or bridi being connected. Specifically,
    “na” negates the first or left-hand sumti or bridi, and
    “nai” negates the second or right-hand one.</p>

    <p>Whenever a logical connective occurs in a sentence, that
    sentence can be expanded into two sentences by repeating the
    common terms and joining the sentences by a logical connective
    beginning with “.i”. Thus the following sentence:</p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">10.1)</a>    mi .e do klama ti
    I and you come here.
</pre>
    can be expanded to: 
<pre>
<a id="10-2"
name="10-2">10.2)</a>    mi klama ti  .ije do klama ti
    I come here, and, you come here.
</pre>

    <p>The same type of expansion can be performed for any logical
    connective, with any valid combination of “na” or “nai”
    attached. No change in meaning occurs under such a
    transformation.</p>

    <p>Clearly, if we know what negation means in the expanded
    sentence forms, then we know what it means in all of the other
    forms. But what does negation mean between sentences?</p>

    <p>The mystery is easily solved. A negation in a logical
    expression is identical to the corresponding bridi negation,
    with the negator placed at the beginning of the prenex.
    Thus:</p>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">10.3)</a>    mi .enai do prami roda
    I, and not you, love everything.
</pre>
    expands to: 
<pre>
<a id="10-4"
name="10-4">10.4)</a>    mi prami roda  .ijenai do prami roda
    I love everything, and-not, you love everything.
</pre>
    and then into prenex form as: 
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">10.5)</a>    roda zo’u mi prami da
        .ije naku zo’u do prami da
    For each thing: I love it,
        and it is false that you love (the same) it.
</pre>
    By the rules of predicate logic, the “ro” quantifier on
    “da” has scope over both sentences. That is, once you’ve
    picked a value for “da” for the first sentence, it stays the
    same for both sentences. (The “da” continues with the same
    fixed value until a new paragraph or a new prenex resets the
    meaning.) 

    <p>Thus the following example has the indicated
    translation:</p>
<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">10.6)</a>    su’oda zo’u mi prami da
        .ije naku zo’u do prami da
    For at least one thing: I love that thing.
        And it is false that: you love that (same) thing.
    There is something that I love that you don’t.
</pre>
    If you remember only two rules for prenex manipulation of
    negations, you won’t go wrong: 

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>Within a prenex, whenever you move “naku” past a bound
      variable (da, de, di, etc.), you must invert the
      quantifier.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>A “na” before the selbri is always transformed into a
      “naku” at the left-hand end of the prenex, and vice
      versa.</dd>
    </dl>
