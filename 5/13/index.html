          <h3>13. Tenses and bridi negation</h3>

    <p>A bridi can have cmavo associated with it which specify the
    time, place, or mode of action. For example, in</p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">13.1)</a>    mi pu klama le zarci
    I [past] go to-the market.
    I went to the market.
</pre>
    the cmavo “pu” specifies that the action of the speaker going
    to the market takes place in the past. Tenses are explained in
    full detail in <a href="../../10/1/">Chapter 10</a>. Tense is
    semantically a property of the entire bridi; however, the usual
    syntax for tenses attaches them at the front of the selbri, as
    in <a href="../13/#1">Example 13.1</a>. There are alternative
    ways of expressing tense information as well. Modals, which are
    explained in <a href="../../9/1/">Chapter 9</a>, behave in the
    same way as tenses. 

    <p>Similarly, a bridi may have the particle “na” (of selma'o
    NA) attached to the beginning of the selbri to negate the
    bridi. A negated bridi expresses what is false without saying
    anything about what is true. Do not confuse this usage with the
    scalar negation of <a href=../12/>Section 12</a>. For
    example:</p>
<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">13.2)</a>    la djonz. na pamoi cusku
    Jones (Not!) is-the-first speaker
    It is not true that Jones is the first speaker.
    Jones isn't the first speaker.
</pre>

    <p>Jones may be the second speaker, or not a speaker at all; <a
    href="../13/#2">Example 13.2</a> doesn't say. There are other
    ways of expressing bridi negation as well; the topic is
    explained fully in <a href="../../15/1/">Chapter 15</a>.</p>

    <p>Various combinations of tense and bridi negation cmavo are
    permitted. If both are expressed, either order is permissible
    with no change in meaning:</p>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">13.3)</a>    mi na pu klama le zarci
    mi pu na klama le zarci
    It is false that I went to the market.
    I didn't go to the market.
</pre>
    It is also possible to have more than one “na”, in which case
    pairs of “na” cmavo cancel out: 
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">13.4)</a>    mi na na klama le zarci
    It is false that it is false that I go to the market.
    I go to the market.
</pre>
    It is even possible, though somewhat pointless, to have
    multiple “na” cmavo and tense cmavo mixed together, subject
    to the limitation that two adjacent tense cmavo will be
    understood as a compound tense, and must fit the grammar of
    tenses as explained in <a href="../../10/1/">Chapter 10</a>. 
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">13.5)</a>    mi na pu na ca klama le zarci
    I [not] [past]
        [not] [present] go to-the market
    It is not the case that in the past it was not
        the case that in the present I went
        to the market.
    I didn't not go to the market.
    I went to the market.
</pre>
    Tense, modal, and negation cmavo can appear only at the
    beginning of the selbri. They cannot be embedded within it.
