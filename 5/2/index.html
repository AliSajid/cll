          <h3>2. Simple tanru</h3>

    <p>Beyond the single brivla, a selbri may consist of two brivla
    placed together. When a selbri is built in this way from more
    than one brivla, it is called a tanru, a word with no single
    English equivalent. The nearest analogue to tanru in English
    are combinations of two nouns such as ``lemon tree''. There is
    no way to tell just by looking at the phrase ``lemon tree''
    exactly what it refers to, even if you know the meanings of
    ``lemon'' and ``tree'' by themselves. As English-speakers, we
    must simply know that it refers to ``a tree which bears lemons
    as fruits''. A person who didn't know English very well might
    think of it as analogous to ``brown tree'' and wonder, ``What
    kind of tree is lemon-colored?''</p>

    <p>In Lojban, tanru are also used for the same purposes as
    English adjective- noun combinations like ``big boy'' and
    adverb-verb combinations like ``quickly run''. This is a
    consequence of Lojban not having any such categories as
    ``noun'', ``verb'', ``adjective'', or ``adverb''. English words
    belonging to any of these categories are translated by simple
    brivla in Lojban. Here are some examples of tanru:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">2.1)</a>  tu pelnimre tricu
    that-yonder is-a-(lemon tree).
    That is a lemon tree.

<a id="2" name="2">2.2)</a>   la djan. barda nanla
    John is-a-big boy.
    John is a big boy.

<a id="3" name="3">2.3)</a>   mi sutra bajra
    I quick run.
    I quickly run/I run quickly.
</pre>

    <p>Note that ``pelnimre'' is a lujvo for ``lemon''; it is
    derived from the gismu ``pelxu'', yellow, and ``nimre'',
    citrus. Note also that ``sutra'' can mean ``fast/quick'' or
    ``quickly'' depending on its use:</p>
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">2.4)</a>  mi sutra
    I am-fast/quick.
</pre>
    shows ``sutra'' used to translate an adjective, whereas in <a
    href="../2/#3">Example 2.3</a> it is translating an adverb.
    (Another correct translation of <a href="../2/#3">Example
    2.3</a>, however, would be ``I am a quick runner''.) 

    <p>There are special Lojban terms for the two components of a
    tanru, derived from the place structure of the word ``tanru''.
    The first component is called the ``seltau'', and the second
    component is called the ``tertau''.</p>

    <p>The most important rule for use in interpreting tanru is
    that the tertau carries the primary meaning. A ``pelnimre
    tricu'' is primarily a tree, and only secondarily is it
    connected with lemons in some way. For this reason, an
    alternative translation of <a href="../2/#1">Example 2.1</a>
    would be:</p>
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">2.5)</a>  That is a lemon type of tree.
</pre>

    <p>This ``type of'' relationship between the components of a
    tanru is fundamental to the tanru concept.</p>

    <p>We may also say that the seltau modifies the meaning of the
    tertau:</p>
<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">2.6)</a>  That is a tree which is lemon-ish
        (in the way appropriate to trees)
</pre>
    would be another possible translation of <a
    href="../2/#1">Example 2.1</a>. In the same way, a more explicit
    translation of <a href="../2/#2">Example 2.2</a> might be: 
<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">2.7)</a>  John is a boy who is big in the way that boys are big.
</pre>

    <p>This ``way that boys are big'' would be quite different from
    the way in which elephants are big; big-for-a-boy is
    small-for-an-elephant.</p>

    <p>All tanru are ambiguous semantically. Possible translations
    of:</p>
<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">2.8)</a>  ta klama jubme
    That is-a-goer type-of-table.
</pre>
    include: 

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>That is a table which goes (a wheeled table, perhaps).
      That is a table owned by one who goes. That is a table used
      by those who go (a sports doctor's table?). That is a table
      when it goes (otherwise it is a chair?).</dd>
    </dl>
    In each case the object referred to is a ``goer type of
    table'', but the ambiguous ``type of'' relationship can mean
    one of many things. A speaker who uses tanru (and pragmatically
    all speakers must) takes the risk of being misunderstood. Using
    tanru is convenient because they are short and expressive; the
    circumlocution required to squeeze out all ambiguity can
    require too much effort. 

    <p>No general theory covering the meaning of all possible tanru
    exists; probably no such theory can exist. However, some
    regularities obviously do exist:</p>
<pre>
<a id="9" name="9">2.9)</a>  do barda prenu
    You are-a-large person.

<a id="10" name="10">2.10)</a> do cmalu prenu
    You are-a-small person.
</pre>
    are parallel tanru, in the sense that the relationship between
    ``barda'' and ``prenu'' is the same as that between ``cmalu''
    and ``prenu''. <a href=../14/>Section 14</a> and <a
    href=../15/>Section 15</a> contain a partial listing of some
    types of tanru, with examples.
