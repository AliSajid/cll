          <h3>7. Linked sumti: “be&ndash;bei&ndash;be'o”</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
     be      BE                  linked sumti marker
     bei     BEI                 linked sumti separator
     be'o    BEhO                linked sumti terminator
</pre>

    <p>The question of the place structures of selbri has been
    glossed over so far. This chapter does not attempt to treat
    place structure issues in detail; they are discussed in <a
    href="../../9/1/">Chapter 9</a>. One grammatical structure
    related to places belongs here, however. In simple sentences
    such as <a href="../1/#1">Example 1.1</a>, the place structure of
    the selbri is simply the defined place structure of the gismu
    “mamta”. What about more complex selbri?</p>

    <p>For tanru, the place structure rule is simple: the place
    structure of a tanru is always the place structure of its
    tertau. Thus, the place structure of “blanu zdani” is that of
    “zdani”: the x1 place is a house or nest, and the x2 place is
    its occupants.</p>

    <p>What about the places of “blanu”? Is there any way to get
    them into the act? In fact, “blanu” has only one place, and
    this is merged, as it were, with the x1 place of “zdani”. It
    is whatever is in the x1 place that is being characterized as
    blue-for-a-house. But if we replace “blanu” with “xamgu”,
    we get:

<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">7.1)</a>  ti xamgu zdani
    this is-a-good house.
    This is a good (for someone, by some standard) house.
</pre>

    Since “xamgu” has three places (x1, the good thing; x2,
    the person for whom it is good; and x3, the standard of
    goodness), <a href="../7/#1">Example 7.1</a> necessarily omits
    information about the last two: there is no room for them. Room
    can be made, however!

<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">7.2)</a>  ti xamgu be do bei mi [be'o] zdani
    this is-a-good (for you by-standard me) house.
    This is a house that is good for you by my standards.
</pre>

    Here, the gismu “xamgu” has been followed by the cmavo “be”
    (of selma'o BE), which signals that one or more sumti follows.
    These sumti are not part of the overall bridi place structure,
    but fill the places of the brivla they are attached to,
    starting with x2. If there is more than one sumti, they are
    separated by the cmavo “bei” (of selma'o BEI), and the list
    of sumti is terminated by the elidable terminator “be'o” (of
    selma'o BEhO).</p> 

    <p>Grammatically, a brivla with sumti linked to it in this
    fashion plays the same role in tanru as a simple brivla. To
    illustrate, here is a fully fleshed-out version of <a
    href="../3/#4">Example 3.4</a>, with all places filled in:

<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">7.3)</a>  ti cmalu be le ka canlu
                     bei lo'e ckule be'o
           nixli be li mu bei lo merko be'o bo
                     ckule la bryklyn. loi pemci
                              le mela nu,IORK. prenu
                              le jecta

     This is a small (in-dimension the property-of volume
                     by-standard the-typical school)
           (girl (of-years the-number five by-standard some American-thing)
                     school) in-Brooklyn with-subject poems
                              for-audience New-York persons
                              with-operator the state.

     This is a school, small in volume compared to the typical school, pertaining
     to five-year-old girls (by American standards), in Brooklyn, teaching poetry
     to the New York community and operated by the state.
</pre>

    Here the three places of “cmalu”, the three of “nixli”,
    and the four of “ckule” are fully specified. Since the places
    of “ckule” are the places of the bridi as a whole, it was not
    necessary to link the sumti which follow “ckule”. It would
    have been legal to do so, however:

<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">7.4)</a>  mi klama be le zarci bei le zdani [be'o]
    I go (to-the market from-the house).
</pre>

    means the same as

<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">7.5)</a>  mi klama le zarci le zdani
    I go to-the market from-the house.
</pre>

    No matter how complex a tanru gets, the last brivla always
    dictates the place structure: the place structure of 

<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">7.6)</a>  melbi je cmalu nixli bo ckule
    a (pretty and little) (girl school)
    a school for girls which is both beautiful and small
</pre>

    is simply that of “ckule”. (The sole exception to this rule
    is discussed in <a href=../8/>Section 8</a>.)</p>

    <p>It is possible to precede linked sumti by the place
    structure ordering tags “fe”, “fi”, “fo”, and “fu” (of
    selma'o FA, discussed further in <a href="../../9/1/">Chapter
    9</a>), which serve to explicitly specify the x2, x3, x4, and
    x5 places respectively. Normally, the place following the
    “be” is the x2 place and the other places follow in order. If
    it seems convenient to change the order, however, it can be
    accomplished as follows:

<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">7.7)</a>  ti xamgu be fi mi bei fe do [be'o] zdani
    this is-a-good ( by-standard me for you ) house
</pre>

    which is equivalent in meaning to <a href="../7/#2">Example
    7.2</a>. Note that the order of “be”, “bei”, and “be'o”
    does not change; only the inserted “fi” tells us that “mi”
    is the x3 place (and correspondingly, the inserted “fe” tells
    us that “do” is the x2 place). Changing the order of sumti is
    often done to match the order of another language, or for
    emphasis or rhythm.</p>

    <p>Of course, using FA cmavo makes it easy to specify one place
    while omitting a previous place:

<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">7.8)</a>  ti xamgu be fi mi [be'o] zdani
    this is-a-good (by-standard me) house
    This is a good house by my standards.
</pre>

    Similarly, sumti labeled by modal or tense tags can be inserted
    into strings of linked sumti just as they can into bridi:

<pre>
<a id="9" name="9">7.9)</a>  ta blanu be ga'a mi [be'o] zdani
    That is-a-blue (to-observer me) house.
    That is a blue, as I see it, house.
</pre>

    The meaning of <a href="../7/#9">Example 7.9</a> is slightly
    different from:

<pre>
<a id="10" name="10">7.10)</a>  ta blanu zdani ga'a mi
     That is-a-blue house to-observer me.
     That is a blue house, as I see it.
</pre>

    See discussions in <a href="../../9/1/">Chapter 9</a> of
    modals and in <a href="../../10/1/">Chapter 10</a> of tenses
    for more explanations.</p>

    <p>The terminator “be'o” is almost always elidable: however,
    if the selbri belongs to a description, then a relative clause
    following it will attach to the last linked sumti unless
    “be'o” is used, in which case it will attach to the outer
    description:

<pre>
<a id="11" name="11">7.11)</a>  le xamgu be do noi barda cu zdani
     The good-thing for you (who are-large) is-a-house.

<a id="12" name="12">7.12)</a> le xamgu be do be'o noi barda cu zdani
     The (good-thing for you) (which is-large) is-a-house
</pre>

    (Relative clauses are explained in <a href="../../8/1/">Chapter
    8</a>.)</p>

    <p>In other cases, however, “be'o” cannot be elided if “ku”
    has also been elided:

<pre>
<a id="13" name="13">7.13)</a>  le xamgu be le ctuca [ku] be'o zdani
     the good (for the teacher) house
</pre>

    requires either “ku” or “be'o”, and since there is only one
    occurrence of “be”, the “be'o” must match it, whereas it
    may be confusing which occurrence of “le” the “ku”
    terminates (in fact the second one is correct).</p>
