          <h3><a id="9" name="9">9. Other kinds of simple selbri</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   go'i    GOhA    repeats the previous bridi
    du  GOhA    equality
    nu'a    NUhA    math operator to selbri
    moi MOI changes number to ordinal selbri
    mei MOI changes number to cardinal selbri
    nu  NU  event abstraction
    kei KEI terminator for ``nu''
</pre>
    So far we have only discussed brivla and tanru built up from
    brivla as possible selbri. In fact, there are a few other
    constructions in Lojban which are grammatically equivalent to
    brivla: they can be used either directly as selbri, or as
    components in tanru. Some of these types of simple selbri are
    discussed at length in <a href="../../7/1/">Chapter 7</a>, <a
    href="../../11/1/">Chapter 11</a>, and <a
    href="../../18/1/">Chapter 18</a>; but for completeness these
    types are mentioned here with a brief explanation and an
    example of their use in selbri. 

    <p>The cmavo of selma'o GOhA (with one exception) serve as
    pro-bridi, providing a reference to the content of other bridi;
    none of them has a fixed meaning. The most commonly used member
    of GOhA is probably ``go'i'', which amounts to a repetition of
    the previous bridi, or part of it. If I say:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">9.1)</a>  la djan. klama le zarci
    John goes-to the market.
</pre>
    you may retort: 
<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">9.2)</a>  la djan. go'i troci
    John [repeat last] are-a-tryer
    John tries to.
</pre>
    <a href="../9/#2">Example 9.2</a> is short for: 
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">9.3)</a>  la djan. klama be le zarci be'o troci
    John is-a-goer (to the market) type-of trier.
</pre>
    because the whole bridi of <a href="../9/#1">Example 9.1</a> has
    been packaged up into the single word ``go'i'' and inserted
    into <a href="../9/#2">Example 9.2</a>. 

    <p>The exceptional member of GOhA is ``du'', which represents
    the relation of identity. Its place structure is:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>x1 is identical with x2, x3, ...</dd>
    </dl>
    for as many places as are given. More information on selma'o
    GOhA is available in <a href="../../7/1/">Chapter 7</a>. 

    <p>Lojban mathematical expressions (mekso) can be incorporated
    into selbri in two different ways. Mathematical operators such
    as ``su'i'', meaning ``plus'', can be transformed into selbri
    by prefixing them with ``nu'a'' (of selma'o NUhA). The
    resulting place structure is:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>x1 is the result of applying (the operator) to arguments
      x2, x3, etc.</dd>
    </dl>
    for as many arguments as are required. (The result goes in the
    x1 place because the number of following places may be
    indefinite.) For example: 
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">9.4)</a>  li vo nu'a su'i li re li re
    The-number 4 is-the-sum-of the-number 2 and-the-number 2.
</pre>

    <p>A possible tanru example might be:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">9.5)</a>  mi jimpe tu'a nu'a su'i nabmi
    I understand something-about the-mass-of is-the-sum-of problems.
    I understand addition problems.
</pre>
    More usefully, it is possible to combine a mathematical
    expression with a cmavo of selma'o MOI to create one of various
    numerical selbri. Details are available in <a
    href="../../18/1/">Chapter 18</a>. Here are a few tanru: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">9.6)</a>  la prim. palvr. pamoi cusku
    Preem Palver is-the-1-th speaker.
    Preem Palver is the first speaker.
</pre>
<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">9.7)</a>  la an,iis. joi la .asun. bruna remei
    Anyi massed-with Asun are-a-brother type-of-twosome.
    Anyi and Asun are two brothers.
</pre>
    Finally, an important type of simple selbri which is not a
    brivla is the abstraction. Grammatically, abstractions are
    simple: a cmavo of selma'o NU, followed by a bridi, followed by
    the elidable terminator ``kei'' of selma'o KEI. Semantically,
    abstractions are an extremely subtle and powerful feature of
    Lojban whose full ramifications are documented in <a
    href="../../11/1/">Chapter 11</a>. A few examples: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">9.8)</a>  ti nu zdile kei kumfa
    This is-an-event-of amusement room.
    This is an amusement room.
</pre>
    <a href="../9/#8">Example 9.8</a> is quite distinct in meaning
    from: 
<pre>
<a id="9" name="9">9.9)</a>  ti zdile kumfa
    This is-an-amuser room.
</pre>
    which suggests the meaning ``a room that amuses someone''.
