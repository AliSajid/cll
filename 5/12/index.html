          <h3><a id="12" name="12">12. Scalar negation of selbri</h3>

    <p>Negation is too large and complex a topic to explain fully
    in this chapter; see <a href="../../15/1/">Chapter 15</a>. In
    brief, there are two main types of negation in Lojban. This
    section is concerned with so-called ``scalar negation'', which
    is used to state that a true relation between the sumti is
    something other than what the selbri specifies. Scalar negation
    is expressed by cmavo of selma'o NAhE:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="12-1" name="12-1">12.1)</a>    la .alis. cu na'e ke cadzu klama [ke'e] le zarci
    Alice non- (walkingly goes) to-the market.
    Alice other-than (walkingly goes) to-the market.
    Alice doesn't walk to the market.
</pre>
    meaning that Alice's relationship to the market is something
    other than that of walking there. But if the ``ke'' were
    omitted, the result would be: 
<pre>
<a id="12-2" name="12-2">12.2)</a>    la .alis. cu na'e cadzu klama le zarci
    Alice non- walkingly goes to-the market.
    Alice doesn't walk to the market.
</pre>
    meaning that Alice does go there in some way (``klama'' is not
    negated), but by a means other than that of walking. <a
    href="#12-1">Example 12.1</a> negates both ``cadzu'' and
    ``klama'', suggesting that Alice's relation to the market is
    something different from walkingly-going; it might be walking
    without going, or going without walking, or neither. 

    <p>Of course, any of the simple selbri types explained in <a
    href=../9/>Section 9</a> may be used in place of brivla in any
    of these examples:</p>
<pre>
<a id="12-3" name="12-3">12.3)</a>    la djonz. cu na'e pamoi cusku
    Jones is non-1st speaker
    Jones is not the first speaker.
</pre>

    <p>Since only ``pamoi'' is negated, an appropriate inference is
    that he is some other kind of speaker.</p>

    <p>Here is an assortment of more complex examples showing the
    interaction of scalar negation with ``bo'' grouping, ``ke'' and
    ``ke'e'' grouping, logical connection, and sumti linked with
    ``be'' and ``bei'':</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="12-4" name="12-4">12.4)</a>    mi na'e sutra cadzu be fi le birka be'o
        klama le zarci
    I ((non-quickly) ( walking using the arms))
        go-to the market.
    I go to the market, walking using my arms
        other than quickly.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#12-4">Example 12.4</a>, ``na'e'' negates only
    ``sutra''. Contrast <a href="#12-5">Example 12.5</a>:</p>
<pre>
<a id="12-5" name="12-5">12.5)</a>    mi na'e ke sutra cadzu be fi le birka [be'o] ke'e
        klama le zarci
    I non- ( quickly (walking using the arms) )
        go-to the market.
    I go to the market, other than by walking
        quickly on my arms.
</pre>

    <p>Now consider <a href="#12-6">Example 12.6</a> and <a
    href="#12-7">Example 12.7</a>, which are equivalent in
    meaning, but use ``ke'' grouping and ``bo'' grouping
    respectively:</p>
<pre>
<a id="12-6" name="12-6">12.6)</a>    mi sutra cadzu be fi le birka be'o je masno
        klama le zarci
    I (quickly -- (walking using the arms) and slowly)
        go-to the market.
    I go to the market, both quickly walking
        using my arms and slowly.

<a id="12-7" name="12-7">12.7)</a> mi ke sutra cadzu be fi le birka [be'o] ke'e
        je masno klama le zarci
    I ((quickly (walking using the arms))
        and slowly) go-to the market.
    I go to the market, both quickly walking
        using my arms and slowly.
</pre>

    <p>However, if we place a ``na'e'' at the beginning of the
    selbri in both <a href="#12-6">Example 12.6</a> and <a
    href="#12-7">Example 12.7</a>, we get different results:</p>
<pre>
<a id="12-8" name="12-8">12.8)</a>    mi na'e sutra cadzu be fi le birka be'o
        je masno klama le zarci
    I ((non- quickly) -- (walking using the arms)
        and slowly) go-to the market.
    I go to the market, both walking using my arms
        other than quickly, and also slowly.

<a id="12-9" name="12-9">12.9)</a> mi na'e ke sutra cadzu be fi le birka [be'o] ke'e
        je masno klama le zarci
    I (non-(quickly (walking using the arms))
        and slowly) go-to the market.
    I go to the market, both other than quickly
        walking using my arms, and also slowly.
</pre>

    <p>The difference arises because the ``na'e'' in <a
    href="#12-9">Example 12.9</a> negates the whole construction
    from ``ke'' to ``ke'e'', whereas in <a href="#12-8">Example
    12.8</a> it negates ``sutra'' alone.</p>

    <p>Beware of omitting terminators in these complex examples! If
    the explicit ``ke'e'' is left out in <a href="#12-9">Example
    12.9</a>, it is transformed into:</p>
<pre>
<a id="12-10" name="12-10">12.10)</a>  mi na'e ke sutra cadzu be fi le birka be'o
        je masno klama [ke'e] le zarci
    I non-(quickly ((walking using the arms))
        and slowly) go-to) the market.
    I do something other than quickly both
        going to the market walking using my arms
        and slowly going to the market.
</pre>

    <p>And if both ``ke'e'' and ``be'o'' are omitted, the results
    are even sillier:</p>
<pre>
<a id="12-11" name="12-11">12.11)</a>  mi na'e ke sutra cadzu be fi le birka
        je masno klama [be'o] [ke'e] le zarci
    I non-(quickly walk on my (arm-type
        and slow) goers) on the market.
    I do something other than quickly walking using the
        goers, both arm-type and slow, relative-to the market.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#12-11">Example 12.11</a>, everything after
    ``be'' is a linked sumti, so the place structure is that of
    ``cadzu'', whose x2 place is the surface walked upon. It is
    less than clear what an ``arm-type goer'' might be.
    Furthermore, since the x3 place has been occupied by the linked
    sumti, the ``le zarci'' following the selbri falls into the
    nonexistent x4 place of ``cadzu''. As a result, the whole
    example, though grammatical, is complete nonsense. (The
    bracketed Lojban words appear where a fluent Lojbanist would
    understand them to be implied.)</p>

    <p>Finally, it is also possible to place ``na'e'' before a
    ``gu'e ... gi'' logically connected tanru construction. The
    meaning of this usage has not yet been firmly established.</p>
