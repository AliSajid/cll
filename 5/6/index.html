          <h3><a id="6" name="6">6. Logical connection within tanru</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   je  JA  tanru logical ``and''
    ja  JA  tanru logical ``or''
    joi JOI mixed mass ``and''
    gu'e    GUhA    tanru forethought logical ``and''
    gi  GI  forethought connection separator
</pre>
    Consider the English phrase ``big red dog''. How shall this be
    rendered as a Lojban tanru? The naive attempt: 
<pre>
<a id="1" name="1">6.1)</a>  barda xunre gerku
    (big type-of red) type-of dog
</pre>
    will not do, as it means a dog whose redness is big, in
    whatever way redness might be described as ``big''. Nor is 
<pre>
<a id="2" name="2">6.2)</a>  barda xunre bo gerku
    big type-of (red type-of dog)
</pre>
    much better. After all, the straightforward understanding of
    the English phrase is that the dog is big as compared with
    other dogs, not merely as compared with other red dogs. In
    fact, the bigness and redness are independent properties of the
    dog, and only obscure rules of English adjective ordering
    prevent us from saying ``red big dog''. 

    <p>The Lojban approach to this problem is to introduce the
    cmavo ``je'', which is one of the many equivalents of English
    ``and''. A big red dog is one that is both big and red, and we
    can say:</p>
<pre>
<a id="3" name="3">6.3)</a>  barda je xunre gerku
    (big and red) type-of dog
</pre>

    <p>Of course,</p>
<pre>
<a id="4" name="4">6.4)</a>  xunre je barda gerku
    (red and big) type-of dog
</pre>
    is equally satisfactory and means the same thing. As these
    examples indicate, joining two brivla with ``je'' makes them a
    unit for tanru purposes. However, explicit grouping with ``bo''
    or ``ke ... ke'e'' associates brivla more closely than ``je''
    does: 
<pre>
<a id="5" name="5">6.5)</a>  barda je pelxu bo xunre gerku
    barda je ke pelxu xunre ke'e gerku
    (big and (yellow type-of red)) dog
    big yellowish-red dog
</pre>

    <p>With no grouping indicators, we get:</p>
<pre>
<a id="6" name="6">6.6)</a>  barda je pelxu xunre gerku
    ((big and yellow) type-of red) type-of dog
    biggish- and yellowish-red dog
</pre>
    which again raises the question of <a href="../6/#1">Example
    6.1</a>: what is does ``biggish-red'' mean? 

    <p>Unlike ``bo'' and ``ke ... ke'e'', ``je'' is useful as well
    as merely legal within simple tanru. It may be used to partly
    resolve the ambiguity of simple tanru:</p>
<pre>
<a id="7" name="7">6.7)</a>  ta blanu je zdani
    that is-blue and is-a-house
</pre>
    definitely refers to something which is both blue and is a
    house, and not to any of the other possible interpretations of
    simple ``blanu zdani''. Furthermore, ``blanu zdani'' refers to
    something which is blue in the way that houses are blue;
    ``blanu je zdani'' has no such implication --- the blueness of
    a ``blanu je zdani'' is independent of its houseness. 

    <p>With the addition of ``je'', many more versions of ``pretty
    little girls' school'' are made possible: see <a
    href=../16/>Section 16</a> for a complete list.</p>

    <p>A subtle point in the semantics of tanru like <a
    href="../6/#3">Example 6.3</a> needs special elucidation. There
    are at least two possible interpretations of:</p>
<pre>
<a id="8" name="8">6.8)</a>  ta melbi je nixli ckule
    That is-a-(beautiful and girl) type-of school.
</pre>

    <p>It can be understood as:</p>
<pre>
<a id="9" name="9">6.9)</a>  That is a girls' school and a beautiful school.
</pre>
    or as: 
<pre>
<a id="10" name="10">6.10)</a>    That is a school for things
        which are both girls and beautiful.
</pre>
    The interpretation specified by <a href="../6/#9">Example 6.9</a>
    treats the tanru as a sort of abbreviation for: 
<pre>
<a id="11" name="11">6.11)</a>    ta ke melbi ckule ke'e
        je ke nixli ckule [ke'e]
    That is-a-( beautiful type-of school )
        and ( girl type-of school )
</pre>
    whereas the interpretation specified by <a
    href="../6/#10">Example 6.10</a> does not. This is a kind of
    semantic ambiguity for which Lojban does not compel a firm
    resolution. The way in which the school is said to be of type
    ``beautiful and girl'' may entail that it is separately a
    beautiful school and a girls' school; but the alternative
    interpretation, that the members of the school are beautiful
    and girls, is also possible. Still another interpretation is: 
<pre>
<a id="12" name="12">6.12)</a>    That is a school for beautiful things
        and also for girls.
</pre>
    so while the logical connectives help to resolve the meaning of
    tanru, they by no means compel a single meaning in and of
    themselves. 

    <p>In general, logical connectives within tanru cannot undergo
    the formal manipulations that are possible with the related
    logical connectives that exist outside tanru; see <a
    href="../../14/1/">Chapter 14</a> for further details.</p>

    <p>The logical connective ``je'' is only one of the fourteen
    logical connectives that Lojban provides. Here are a few
    examples of some of the others:</p>
<pre>
<a id="13" name="13">6.13)</a>    le bajra cu jinga ja te jinga
    the runner(s) is/are winner(s) or loser(s).

<a id="14" name="14">6.14)</a> blanu naja lenku skapi
    (blue only-if cold) skin
    skin which is blue only if it is cold

<a id="15" name="15">6.15)</a> xamgu jo cortu nuntavla
    (good if-and-only-if short) speech
    speech which is good if (and only if) it is short

<a id="16" name="16">6.16)</a> vajni ju pluka nuntavla
    (important whether-or-not pleasing) event-of-talking
    speech which is important, whether or not it is pleasing
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="../6/#13">Example 6.13</a>, ``ja'' is
    grammatically equivalent to ``je'' but means ``or'' (more
    precisely, ``and/or''). Likewise, ``naja'' means ``only if'' in
    <a href="../6/#14">Example 6.14</a>, ``jo'' means ``if and only
    if'' in <a href="../6/#15">Example 6.15</a>, and ``ju'' means
    ``whether or not'' in <a href="../6/#16">Example 6.16</a>.</p>

    <p>Now consider the following example:</p>
<pre>
<a id="17" name="17">6.17)</a>    ricfu je blanu jabo crino
    rich and (blue or green)
</pre>
    which illustrates a new grammatical feature: the use of both
    ``ja'' and ``bo'' between tanru components. The two cmavo
    combine to form a compound whose meaning is that of ``ja'' but
    which groups more closely; ``jabo'' is to ``ja'' as plain
    ``bo'' is to no cmavo at all. However, both ``ja'' and ``jabo''
    group less closely than ``bo'' does: 
<pre>
<a id="18" name="18">6.18)</a>    ricfu je blanu jabo crino bo blanu
    rich and (blue or green -- blue)
    rich and (blue or greenish-blue)
</pre>

    <p>An alternative form of <a href="../6/#17">Example 6.17</a>
    is:</p>
<pre>
<a id="19" name="19">6.19)</a>    ricfu je ke blanu ja crino [ke'e]
    rich and ( blue or green )
</pre>
    In addition to the logical connectives, there are also a
    variety of non-logical connectives, grammatically equivalent to
    the logical ones. The only one with a well-understood meaning
    in tanru contexts is ``joi'', which is the kind of ``and'' that
    denotes a mixture: 
<pre>
<a id="20" name="20">6.20)</a>    ti blanu joi xunre bolci
    This is-a-(blue and red) ball.
</pre>

    <p>The ball described is neither solely red nor solely blue,
    but probably striped or in some other way exhibiting a
    combination of the two colors. <a href="../6/#20">Example
    6.20</a> is distinct from:</p>
<pre>
<a id="21" name="21">6.21)</a>    ti blanu xunre bolci
    This is a bluish-red ball
</pre>
    which would be a ball whose color is some sort of purple
    tending toward red, since ``xunre'' is the more important of
    the two components. On the other hand, 
<pre>
<a id="22" name="22">6.22)</a>    ti blanu je xunre bolci
    This is a (blue and red) ball
</pre>
    is probably self-contradictory, seeming to claim that the ball
    is independently both blu and red at the same time, although
    some sensible interpretation may exist. 

    <p>Finally, just as English ``and'' has the variant form ``both
    ... and'', so ``je'' between tanru components has the variant
    form ``gu'e ... gi'', where ``gu'e'' is placed before the
    components and ``gi'' between them:</p>
<pre>
<a id="23" name="23">6.23)</a>    gu'e barda gi xunre gerku
    (both big and red) type-of dog
</pre>
    is equivalent in meaning to <a href="../6/#3">Example 6.3</a>.
    For each logical connective related to ``je'', there is a
    corresponding connective related to ``gu'e ... gi'' in a
    systematic way. 

    <p>The portion of a ``gu'e ... gi'' construction before the
    ``gi'' is a full selbri, and may use any of the selbri
    resources including ``je'' logical connections. After the
    ``gi'', logical connections are taken to be wider in scope than
    the ``gu'e ... gi'', which has in effect the same scope as
    ``bo'':</p>
<pre>
<a id="24" name="24">6.23)</a>    gu'e barda je xunre gi gerku ja mlatu
    (both (big and red) and dog) or cat
    something which is either big, red, and a dog,
        or else a cat
</pre>
    leaves ``mlatu'' outside the ``gu'e--gi'' construction. The
    scope of the ``gi'' arm extends only to a single brivla or to
    two or more brivla connected with ``bo'' or ``ke--ke'e''.
