    <h3><a id="s11" name="s11">11. Abstraction focus pro-sumti: ``ce'u''</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   ce'u    KOhA            abstraction focus
</pre>
    The cmavo ``ce'u'' is used within abstraction bridi,
    particularly property abstractions introduced by the cmavo
    ``ka''. Abstractions, including the uses of ``ce'u'', are
    discussed in full in <a href="../c11/s1.html">Chapter 11</a>. 

    <p>In brief: Every property abstraction specifies a property of
    one of the sumti in it; that sumti place is filled by using
    ``ce'u''. This convention enables us to distinguish clearly
    between:</p>

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e11d1" name="e11d1">11.1)</a>    le ka ce'u gleki
    the property-of (X being-happy)
    the property of being happy
    happiness
</pre>
    and 
<pre>
<a id="e11d2" name="e11d2">11.2)</a>    le ka gleki ce'u
    the property-of (being-happy about-X)
    the property of being that which
        someone is happy about
