          <h3><a id="s2" name="s2">2. Personal pro-sumti: the mi-series</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   mi  KOhA    mi-series   I, me
    do  KOhA    mi-series   you
    mi'o    KOhA    mi-series   you and I
    mi'a    KOhA    mi-series   I and others,
                    we but not you
    ma'a    KOhA    mi-series   you and I and others
    do'o    KOhA    mi-series   you and others
    ko  KOhA    mi-series   you-imperative
</pre>
    The mi-series of pro-sumti refer to the speaker, the listener,
    and others in various combinations. ``mi'' refers to the
    speaker and perhaps others for whom the speaker speaks; it may
    be a Lojbanic mass. ``do'' refers to the listener or listeners.
    Neither ``mi'' nor ``do'' is specific about the number of
    persons referred to; for example, the foreman of a jury may
    refer to the members of the jury as ``mi'', since in speaking
    officially he represents all of them. 

    <p>The referents of ``mi'' and ``do'' are usually obvious from
    the context, but may be assigned by the vocative words of
    selma'o COI, explained in <a href="../c13/s1.html">Chapter 13</a>.
    The vocative ``mi'e'' assigns ``mi'', whereas all of the other
    vocatives assign ``do''.</p>
<pre>
<a id="e2d1" name="e2d1">2.1)</a>  mi'e djan. doi frank.
        mi cusku lu mi bajra li'u do
    I-am John, O Frank,
        I express [quote] I run [unquote] to-you
    I am John, Frank; I tell you ``I run''.
</pre>
    The cmavo ``mi'o'', ``mi'a'', ``ma'a'', and ``do'o'' express
    various combinations of the speaker and/or the listener and/or
    other people: 

    <dl>
      <dt></dt>

      <dd>``mi'o'' includes only the speaker and the listener but
      no one else; ``mi'a'' includes the speaker and others but
      excludes the listener;</dd>

      <dt></dt>

      <dd>``do'o'' includes the listener and others but excludes
      the speaker;</dd>

      <dt></dt>

      <dd>``ma'a'' includes all three: speaker, listener,
      others.</dd>
    </dl>
    All of these pro-sumti represent masses. For example, ``mi'o''
    is the same as ``mi joi do'', the mass of me and you considered
    jointly. 

    <p>In English, ``we'' can mean ``mi'' or ``mi'o'' or ``mi'a''
    or even ``ma'a'', and English-speakers often suffer because
    they mistake ``mi'o'' for ``mi'a'':</p>
<pre>
<a id="e2d2" name="e2d2">2.2)</a>  We're going to the store.
</pre>

    <p>Does this include the listener or not? There's no way to be
    sure.</p>

    <p>Finally, the cmavo ``ko'' is logically equivalent to ``do'';
    its referent is the listener. However, its use alters an
    assertion about the listener into a command to the listener to
    make the assertion true:</p>
<pre>
<a id="e2d3" name="e2d3">2.3)</a>  do klama le zarci
    You go to-the store.
</pre>
    becomes: 
<pre>
<a id="e2d4" name="e2d4">2.4)</a>  ko klama le zarci
    You [imperative] go to-the store.
    Make ``you go to the store'' true!
    Go to the store!
</pre>
    In English, the subject of a command is omitted, but in Lojban,
    the word ``ko'' must be used. However, ``ko'' does not have to
    appear in the x1 place: 
<pre>
<a id="e2d5" name="e2d5">2.5)</a>  mi viska ko
    I see you [imperative]
    Make ``I see you'' true!
    Be seen by me!
</pre>
    In <a href="#e2d5">Example 2.5</a>, it is necessary to make the
    verb passive in English in order to convey the effect of ``ko''
    in the x2 place. Indeed, ``ko'' does not even have to be a
    sumti of the main bridi: 
<pre>
<a id="e2d6" name="e2d6">2.6)</a>  mi viska le prenu poi prami ko
    I see the person that loves you [imperative]
    Make ``I see the person that loves you'' true!
    Be such that the person who loves you is seen by me!
    Show me the person who loves you!
</pre>
    As mentioned in <a href="s1.html">Section 1</a>, some pro-sumti
    series have corresponding pro-bridi series. However, there is
    no equivalent of the mi-series among pro-bridi, since a person
    isn't a relationship.
