    <h3><a id="s10" name="s10">10. Relativized pro-sumti: ``ke'a''</h3>

    <p>The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</p>
<pre>
   ke'a    KOhA            relativized sumti
</pre>
    This pro-sumti is used in relative clauses (explained in <a
    href="../c8/s1.html">Chapter 8</a>) to indicate how the sumti
    being relativized fits within the clause. For example: 

    <p></p>
<pre>
<a id="e10d1" name="e10d1">10.1)</a>    mi catlu lo mlatu
        poi [zo'e] zbasu
            ke'a
            lei slasi
    I see a cat such-that
        something-unspecified makes
            the-thing-being-relativized [the cat]
            from-some-mass-of plastic.
    I see a cat made of plastic.
</pre>
    If ``ke'a'' were omitted from <a href="#e10d1">Example
    10.1</a>, it might be confused with: 
<pre>
<a id="e10d2" name="e10d2">10.2)</a>    mi catlu lo mlatu poi [ke'a]
        zbasu lei slasi
    I see a cat such-that the-thing-being-relativized
        [the cat] makes a-mass-of plastic
    I see a cat that makes plastic.
</pre>
    The anaphora cmavo ``ri'' cannot be used in place of ``ke'a''
    in <a href="#e10d1">Example 10.1</a> and <a
    href="#e10d2">Example 10.2</a>, because the relativized sumti
    is not yet complete when the ``ke'a'' appears. 

    <p>Note that ``ke'a'' is used only with relative clauses, and
    not with other embedded bridi such as abstract descriptions. In
    the case of relative clauses within relative clauses, ``ke'a''
    may be subscripted to make the difference clear (see <a
    href="../c8/s1.html">Chapter 8</a>).</p>
